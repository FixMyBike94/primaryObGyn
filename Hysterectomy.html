    <h1 id="introduction">Hysterectomy</h1>
    <p>You may occasionally need to perform an <i>emergency
        hysterectomy</i> if a patient has:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A ruptured uterus, and repair is impossible
            (not uncommon). </li>
        <li>Uncontrollable postpartum haemorrhage. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>N.B. Hysterectomy for a ruptured uterus (21.17) differs
        in approach from the operation described below. </p>
    <p>N.B. If possible, try to refer all elective cases.
        They may have disastrous complications, even in the
        hands of experts, and their patients even die occasionally.
        <i>So don't perform a hysterectomy, unless you are
        experienced.</i> Fibroids may cause disability,
        but they seldom threaten life. </p>
    <p><b>A total hysterectomy</b> removes the entire uterus;
        the advantage being that you remove the cervix, which is a
        common site for carcinoma. </p>
    <p><b>A subtotal hysterectomy</b> leaves a stump of cervix behind.
        It is contraindicated if there is any suspicion of carcinoma
        in either the cervix or the body of the uterus. But it is an
        easier operation, because you can more easily avoid the
        ureters. It may also prevent a vaginal prolapse later, in
        populations prone to this complication.</p>

    <p>If you are inexperienced, start by doing a subtotal
        operation, particularly if you are operating for fibroids.
        But even this can be difficult, if there are adhesions from
        chronic PID.</p>
    <p><i>Don't attempt a radical hysterectomy</i> which also removes
        the pelvic lymph nodes. It is the only adequate surgical
        treatment for carcinoma of the cervix, but this really is a
        task for an expert with services of an expert anaesthetist
        and urologist available.</p>

    <p>ANATOMY.<br> The most critical items of a patient's pelvic anatomy are the
        ureters (23-20). <q>Ligaments</q> mean quite different things to gynaecologists
        and to orthopaedic surgeons. To gynaecologists a <q>ligament</q> is a fold of
        peritoneum, or a local thickening of the pelvic connective tissue.<br>
        These are: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The broad ligament which is a fold of peritoneum running from the
            Fallopian tubes towards the floor of the pelvis. The ureter and the uterine
            artery lie in the base of the broad ligament; vessels run round its edge,
            and its middle is avascular (21-18). </li>
        <li>The infundibulo-pelvic ligaments are folds of tissue which run from
            the lateral ends of the tubes to the pelvic wall. Their importance is that
            the ovarian vessels run in them</li>
        <li>The round ligaments are folds of tissue which run from the uterus
            close to its junction with the tubes, antero-laterally towards the brim of
            the pelvis. They are really anterior folds or leaves in the broad ligaments.</li>
        <li>The ovarian ligaments support the ovaries, and hang off the back of
            the broad ligaments.</li>
        <li>The cardinal (transverse cervical) ligaments are thickenings of the
            pelvic connective tissue which run laterally from the cervix to the sides of
            the pelvis.</li>
        <li> The utero-sacral ligaments run from the lower segment to the sacrum
            on each side of the rectum. They are, in effect, the posterior edges of the
            cardinal ligaments.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The great danger at hysterectomy is that you may
        damage the ureter by cutting, tying or clamping it.
        The ureter is at risk at several stages: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>when you tie the ovarian vessels. So, lift these
            clear of the ureters beforehand. </li>
        <li>when clamping and tying the exposed broad
            ligament, and where the ureter is displaced by a
            large uterine fibroid.</li>
        <li>when unexpected bleeding is controlled and
            clamps and sutures are placed blindly and too deep.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So before you do anything in this region which
        might injure the ureters, feel for them carefully.
        You can roll a ureter between your finger and
        thumb, and when you pinch it, it vermiculates
        (moves like a worm).</p>
    <p>Bleeding can be severe, especially from the uterine
        vessels. Even when you have divided them, you are
        still in a bloody triangle at the sides of the vaginal
        vault. If you are not careful, you can also cause a
        vesico-vaginal fistula. This will be much less likely
        if:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You develop a bladder flap. </li>
        <li>.You carefully separate the bladder from the
            cervix.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Gentle continued traction is the secret of all pelvic
        surgery: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>It demonstrates the tissue planes.</li>
        <li>You are less likely to pick up structures that you do not
            want to cut.</li>
        <li>Vessels stand out more clearly. </li>
        <li>You are less likely to injure the bladder or the ureter</li>
        <li>You can find the relation of the bladder to the cervix
            and vagina more easily.</li>
    </ol>
    <p id="indications">After the operation, it is painful to bear down to defecate;
        so, make sure your patient is not constipated, and provide
        laxatives if they have such a tendency.</p>
    <p>HYSTERECTOMY (GRADE 3.4)</p>
    <p>INDICATIONS.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Severe anaemia or mechanical problems from large
            fibroids. </li>
        <li>Endometrial carcinoma (Stage I, IIA)<br>
            <i>N.B. A total hysterectomy with adnexectomy is needed
           for cervical carcinoma (23.8)</i></li>
        <li>Severe dysfunctional uterine bleeding (23.3).</li>
        <li>Severe post-abortal or postpartum uterine sepsis.</li>
        <li>Chronic pelvic pain due to PID which fails to respond
            to medical treatment. </li>
        <li id="contraindications">Complete or nearly complete uterine prolapse.<br>
            <i>N.B. In this last case, a vaginal hysterectomy is more
           appropriate (23.11).</i></li>
    </ol>
    <p>CONTRAINDICATIONS</p>
    <ol>
        <li>An inexperienced operator.</li>
        <li>Active PID, but distinguish this from post-abortal or
            postpartum uterine sepsis.</li>
        <li>A uterus 'fixed' in the pelvis.</li>
    </ol>
    <p id="equipment">N.B. <b>Dense adhesions,</b> such as
        those due to PID, fibroids in the
        broad ligament, and obesity may pull
        the ureters out of place and make the
        operation very difficult and
        hazardous. </p>
    <p id="preparation"><i>EQUIPMENT.<br> A general set, a catheter,
        a uterine probe and sounds, a suitable selfretaining retractor, preferably Kirschner's,
        Gosset's, or Balfour's; also a Deaver's
        retractor and a tenaculum forceps. At least 4
        and preferably 6 long curved uterine clamps,
        either Hunter's or Maingot's. 2 large packs
        with cloth tapes, T-tube for ureter repair.</i></p>
    <p>PREPARATION.<br>
        Make sure that consent is signed and
        the patient understands that she will
        have no more children and no
        periods.</p>
    <p>Set up an IV infusion, and have
        blood cross-matched.
        Start prophylactic metronidazole
        1g PR together with gentamicin
        240mg or chloramphenicol 1g IV.
        Find yourself a competent assistant,
        who, if inexperienced, should go
        through this account with you first.</p>
    <p id="incision">Place the patient in the lithotomy
        position, perform a vaginal
        examination (with non sterile gloves)
        to reassess the size, position and
        mobility of the uterus. Then clean
        the vagina with aqueous iodine
        solution. Catheterize the bladder.
        Compress it suprapubically to make
        sure it is empty, and leave the
        catheter in for continuous drainage.
        Then lay the patient supine on the
        table and remove the lithotomy
        poles. Tip the table slightly headdown to let the bowel fall away from
        the pelvic cavity. Provided the angle
        is not too steep, it will not make
        anaesthesia difficult. Ideally, adjust
        the break in the table so that the
        knees are slightly flexed. Stand on
        the left if you are right-handed. </p>
    <p>INCISION. If you are inexperienced, make a midline
        incision from the symphysis to the umbilicus. If you are
        skilled, and the uterus is not >15cm high (equivalent to a
        14-16wk pregnancy), a Pfannenstiel incision gives the best
        cosmetic result and avoids incisional hernias. </p>
    <p> CAUTION! Make sure your incision is long enough,
        and that you have divided the rectus sheath and muscles as
        far as the symphysis pubis (an extra 1cm at the bottom is
        worth 5cm at the top). If necessary, extend the incision
        generously above the umbilicus.</p>

    <p>N.B. The illustrations here assume you are standing on the left, which
        most right-handed surgeons find easier.</p>
    <p>With a Pfannenstiel incision, arrest all the bleeding before
        you enter the abdomen; you might otherwise forget later
        and the result will be an enormous haematoma.</p>
    <p>Open the peritoneum with your finger in the middle of the
        incision, firstly upwards, so as to avoid the bladder more
        easily.</p>
    <p>N.B. An improvement on the Pfannenstiel is the
        Joel-Cohen incision. The incision is not curved and
        slightly closer to the umbilicus; the skin (and later the
        rectus sheet) is only incised full thickness transversely for
        3-4cm across the midline. The rest of the skin is not
        incised full thickness. With digital blunt dissection,
        the wound is opened further, again after the horizontal
        incision of the middle portion of the rectus sheath.
        The rectus muscle (vertically) and peritoneum are
        separated/opened with the index finger. The opening in the
        wall is made as large as that in the skin by manual traction
        after the peritoneum is opened (to prevent disrupting
        vessels between posterior rectus sheath/peritoneum and
        rectus muscle). This approach is very fast, works also
        excellently with a Caesarean Section and minimises blood
        loss from the abdominal wall.</p>
    <p>Exploration is the first step: inspect the pelvic cavity.
        <i>If you find an inflammatory lesion, don't proceed to
        explore the upper abdomen,</i> because you may spread the
        infection. Otherwise, put your left hand into the wound to
        feel the organs in the abdominal cavity quickly and
        thoroughly. Follow a set pattern: look particularly for
        metastases in the liver</p>
    <p>Clear the operative field. This is often the most difficult
        part of the operation. <i>Don't start removing any organs
        until you have cleared the site of operation.</i></p>
    <p>Carefully pack the bowel out of the way with large damp
        packs, attached to a cloth tape, to which a haemostat is
        fixed. Protect the wound edges with moist gauze, and
        insert a 3-blade self-retaining retractor. You can put the
        crossbar towards the head or towards the feet, and use the
        3
        rd blade to retract the bladder. Make sure it does not
        compress the caecum, the sigmoid, the small bowel, or the
        iliac vessels. When necessary, use Deaver's retractor.</p>
    <p>Clear any adherent bowel or omentum from the pelvis.
        Use blunt dissection to free any loose adhesions between
        the uterus and its surrounding structures: the sigmoid
        colon, the ovaries, or the walls of the pelvic cavity.
        The tubes and ovaries may be stuck down behind the broad
        ligaments; get your fingers under them and free them from
        below upwards. You may have to divide denser adhesions
        with scissors, or if you think they are likely to contain
        blood vessels, clamp, divide, and tie them. Divide any
        adhesions between the fundus of the bladder and the
        fundus of the uterus. </p>
    <p>If you can deliver the uterus out of the abdomen,
        especially if it is very big, this will help greatly.
        If you restore the proper anatomy first by removing
        adhesions, you are far less likely later to damage ureters,
        bladder or bowel.</p>
    <p>Put clamps on either side of the fundus of the uterus,
        (23-22A) and over the tubes and round ligaments
        (23-22B). Use them to exert traction, and control arterial
        bleeding.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, if these structures are friable, use a
        myomectomy screw or traction sutures to hold the fundus.</p>
    <p>Ask your assistant to pull on the clamps, so as to
        demonstrate the thin avascular part of the broad ligament
        more clearly. Push your finger through this thin part near
        the uterus, from behind forwards, to make a hole (23-22B).
        Do the same on the other side.</p>
    <p>Reflect the bladder. Incise the peritoneum on the front of
        the cervix, near to its vesico-cervical reflexion (23-22C).
        Dissect the bladder off the front of the cervix and upper
        vagina (23-22D,E), until you can feel the tip of the cervix
        (23-22F). This dissection is best done bluntly with your
        gloved finger or a gauze while your force is exerted in the
        direction of the uterus & cervix, <i>not the bladder.</i>
        If there was a previous Caesarean Section, you often need
        sharp dissection: so cut even into the cervix superficially,
        rather than into the bladder. Feel the cervix from in front
        and behind. Separate the bladder from the underlying
        tissues somewhat laterally also.</p>
    <p>Find the ureters. They enter the pelvis at the bifurcation of
        the iliac vessels. Trace them distally to beyond the tip of
        the cervix; recognize them by their feel: they are rather
        hard, they do not pulsate, and you can roll them between
        your finger and thumb (23-20).</p>
    <p>CAUTION! <i>Ureters are apt to be easy to find when they
        are in no danger, and almost impossible to find when you
        need to find them!</i></p>
    <p><b>If you cannot find the ureters,</b> these steps will protect
        them:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Free the adnexa from adhesions before you remove
            them</li>
        <li>Lift the infundibulo-pelvic ligament and find the
            ovarian vessels before you clamp them.</li>
        <li>Very carefully dissect the bladder away from the
            cervix, and the adjoining part of the broad ligament. </li>
        <li>Cut and mobilize downwards the posterior peritoneal
            leaf of the broad ligament from the posterior surface of the
            cervix and somewhat beyond, and a tiny bit laterally so
            that it is possible to apply a clamp from lateral just under
            the cervix at the last stage of the hysterectomy without
            having any peritoneum in the clamp.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now deal with the ovaries. You must now decide if you
        want to retain them or not. If they have multiple large
        cysts, they are better removed, but try to retain at least
        one ovary if the patient is pre-menopausal, or &#60;5yrs
        post-menopausal. If there are any cysts it is better to
        remove the ovaries in an older postmenopausal woman.</p>
    <p><b>To remove an ovary,</b> going lateral to it, but very near it,
        clamp its vessels, taking care not to clamp the ureter at the
        same time (23-22G). You do not need a counter clamp if
        you have already placed clamps on either side of the
        fundus (see above): this makes it possible to ligate very
        near to the ovary. Otherwise place the other clamp medial
        to the ovary. Divide the ovarian pedicle medial to the
        lateral (not the counter) clamp, and tie it with a double
        transfixion suture using #1 absorbable. Ease and squeeze
        the clamp while tightening the suture to make sure the
        tissues can be compressed properly by the suture.</p>
    <p><i><b>If you remove the ovary, be sure also to remove the
        Fallopian tube with it.</b></i></p>
    <p><b>If you want to retain an ovary</b>, apply a clamp across the
        Fallopian tube and its pedicle, 1cm lateral to the first
        clamp that you applied to these structures near the uterus
        (23-22H). Divide the tissues between these clamps
        (23-22I). Ease and squeeze and then remove the lateral
        clamp and tie its pedicle as above. Do the same thing on
        the other side, removing or retaining the ovary,
        as you decide.</p>
    <p>Define, tie, and divide the lateral end of the round
        ligament. Do this by pushing your finger under it and tying
        it (23-22J,K).</p>
    <p>Find the uterine artery (23-22L). Cut the posterior leaf of
        the broad ligament with the loose areolar tissue inside it,
        almost as far as the artery (23-22K,L). If your assistant
        stretches the broad ligament
        well by pulling on the clamps,
        you may see the artery through
        the tissues you are going to
        cut. Repeat this on the other
        side.</p>
    <p>Ask your assistant to lift up the
        uterus again (23-22M).
        This will demonstrate the
        utero-sacral ligaments. Clamp,
        divide, and tie them (23-22N).
        Dissect the peritoneum off the
        back of the cervix (23-22O),
        if it is not too adherent,
        otherwise leave it.
        The uterus will now be much
        more mobile.</p>
    <p>Feel for the uterine arteries
        again. There is no need to
        dissect them out. Next feel for
        the ureters on each side of the
        distal cervix. Again, identify
        them by their feel: firm cords
        which you can roll between
        your finger and thumb. Doubly
        clamp the pedicle containing
        the uterine artery (23-22P),
        well away from the ureter,
        with the tip of the clamp biting
        the side of the cervix, and
        leaving little or no tissue on
        the uterine side. </p>
    <p>Use scissors, or a knife.
        Cut as near, or even just in the
        uterus, as possible. If you do
        not use 2 clamps on each side,
        apply bilateral single clamps before you start cutting
        because the uterus will start bleeding on one side when the
        uterine artery on the other side is not clamped. Using, in
        this way, 2 clamps instead of 4 makes it possible to divide
        and clamp nearer to the uterus/cervix decreasing the risk to
        the ureters; there is also less clutter in the operative field.</p>
    <p>Put the convex side of the clamp near the uterus so that it
        is easier to get the clamp very near it.</p>
    <p>If the bladder is well down and the posterior leaf of the
        broad ligament out of the way and the clamp (and suture)
        very near to the uterus, then the ureters should be out of
        harm&#39;s way. The clamp is then not on the slippery
        peritoneum. Sometimes it needs 2-3 steps to clamp the
        tissues on each side of the uterus. Place the suture 1mm
        medial and 1mm distal from the point of the clamp while
        laterally, tie it c.1cm under the clamp. This will prevent
        oozing later.</p>
    <p>Complete the task of pushing the bladder down the cervix,
        if you have not already done so (23-23A). Blunt dissection
        is usually enough.</p>
    <p>Now decide if you want to proceed with a subtotal or total
        hysterectomy. If you are inexperienced, do the former.</p>

    <p>SUBTOTAL HYSTERECTOMY<br>
        If you have placed 2 clamps for the
        uterine vessels with their points
        1·5-3cm above the distal end of the
        cervix on the lateral uterine wall,
        release each slightly in turn,
        squeeze again and tie them
        individually after the ligating
        needle has gone through the uterus
        just under the point of the clamp.
        In this way, you will be sure to
        have tied all the vessels lateral to
        the uterine part you are going to
        remove.</p>
    <p>When you are sure you have
        reflected the bladder adequately
        (23-23A), pull on the clamps
        attached to the uterus and incise the
        anterior wall of the cervix, above
        the reflexion of the bladder and the
        stump of the uterine vessel
        (23-23B). Then draw the uterus
        sharply forwards towards the
        symphysis, and incise the posterior
        wall of the cervix (23-23C). Place a
        clamp on its anterior incised edge
        (23-23D).</p>
    <p id="totalHysterectomy">Place a clamp on the posterior cut
        edge of the cervix (23-23E), so that
        you can maintain traction. Bring the
        two cut edges of the cervix together
        to control bleeding. Use a cutting
        Mayo half-circle needle, and place
        the first stitch in the edge of the
        cervix, close to the point where you
        tied the uterine arteries. Control bleeding by placing the
        sutures through the posterior peritoneal reflection, deep
        into the muscle of both lips (23-23F,G,H). Suture the
        round ligaments to the cervix if you can do this easily
        (23-23I).</p>
    <p>TOTAL HYSTERECTOMY </p>
    <p>Cut through the cardinal ligaments flush with the cervix,
        until you feel their ends on each side (23-24A).
        You should now be able to feel the cervix abdominally
        through the wall of the vagina from in front and behind
        with your finger and thumb (23-24B).</p>
    <p>Often it is possible with a total hysterectomy to have the
        cardinal ligament including the utero-sacral ligament in
        the same clamp and hence in the same pedicle as the
        uterine artery.</p>
    <p>So, on one side, you should have the following pedicles:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>the round ligament; </li>
        <li>the doubly ligated infundibulo-pelvic ligament; </li>
        <li>the doubly ligated uterine artery including the cardinal
            ligament; </li>
        <li>tissue just lateral to the distal cervix plus the top ⅓ of
            the vagina.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Before you open the vagina, insert clamps on the vaginal
        angles immediately below the cervix. Ask your assistant to
        pull up the uterus. Make absolutely sure no bowel or
        bladder is in these 2 clamps placed below the cervix.
        Use a broad-bladed or right-angle retractor to pull back the
        bladder carefully.</p>
    <p>Cut the vagina above the clamps as near as possible to the
        cervix. If you can see easily, complete the cut with curved
        scissors (23-24D).</p>
    <p>CAUTION! <i>To avoid damage to the ureters, always
        make sure you find them.</i> Clamp the uterine pedicles away
        from them, and cut the vaginal wall very close to the
        cervix.</p>
    <p>Use #1 long-acting absorbable transfixion sutures to tie the
        vaginal angle and top pedicles bilaterally, <i>making sure that
        you do not include the ureters,</i> keeping the ends long in
        order to tie the uterine artery on each side, once again for
        extra security. If there is some oozing from the open part
        of the vagina, control it with mattress or figure of 8 sutures
        (4-9H).</p>
    <p>If you can easily do so, suture the round ligaments to the
        ends of the vaginal vault (23-24H). This will help to
        prevent prolapse, but is not essential.</p>
    <p>Remove the swab holding the bowel, and close the
        abdomen in the usual way. There is no need for a drain if
        the operation was not for an infection in the first place and
        the bowel or urinary tract was not damaged. Otherwise
        leave the vagina open to help drainage. In serious infection
        leave a large tube draining into the vagina, fixing it from
        inside the abdomen with a thin absorbable suture.</p>
    <p>POST-OPERATIVELY, check the vaginal pads, pulse,
        BP and urine production to make sure there is no bleeding.</p>
    <p id="difficulties">THE SPECIMEN. Open the uterus to see if there is a
        carcinoma of its body. Do this after the operation, to avoid
        contaminating the wound with tumour cells if any are
        present.</p>
    <p>DIFFICULTIES WITH HYSTERECTOMY</p>
    <p><b>If adhesions from old PID or endometriosis prevent
        you starting,</b> begin by dividing the round ligaments.
        Then put your hand behind the uterus and push a finger
        through the broad ligament under the tube and out through
        the divided round ligament. You now have the tube and
        ovarian vessels and can clamp and divide them safely.</p>
    <p><b>If the uterus is so large that it obstructs your access to
        the pelvis,</b> perform a subtotal operation first,
        and cut across the cervix quite high up. When you have
        removed the body of the uterus you will have plenty of
        room to complete the operation</p>
    <p><b>If you cannot find the ureter,</b> but must proceed with the
        operation, keep extremely close to the uterus.
        You will nearly always be safe there.
        Perform a subtotal hysterectomy only.</p>
    <p><b>If a fibroid extends into the broad ligament,</b>
        this may be: (1) growing out from the uterus and displace
        the uterine vessels and ureter downwards, laterally or
        upwards; (2) separate from the uterus and arise de novo
        from the connective tissue in the broad ligament.
        Both are difficult to dissect out.</p>
    <p>In the 1
        st case, divide both the ovarian vessels and dissect
        out the upper part of the fibroid. Then proceed with the
        operation as usual on the normal side of the uterus only.
        Clamp and tie the uterine artery and utero-sacral ligament.
        Cut across the vagina. As you reach the affected side of the
        vagina you will see the uterine artery on that side.
        Clamp and divide it (it may be large) and shell out the
        remainder of the fibroid.</p>
    <p>In the 2nd case, open the broad ligament by dividing the
        round ligament, as you would for a broad ligament cyst.
        The ureter will be attached to the posterior edge of the
        broad ligament above; lower down it will be displaced
        downwards and medially by the fibroid.</p>
    <p><b>If there is a fibroid in the cervix,</b> removing it can be very
        difficult. Limit yourself to a subtotal hysterectomy.</p>
    <p><b>If there is a fibroid low in the posterior uterine wall,</b>
        make a transverse incision over it and shell it (partly) out
        with your finger: this will help mobilise the uterus.
        If the uterus is thus mobilised, a hysterectomy will be
        routine. You may then be able to ligate the vessels leading
        to the fibroid and can then close the resulting cavity, so
        that the hysterectomy is no longer necessary.</p>
    <p><b>If you divide the ureter</b> and recognize that you have done
        so, repair the ureter with continuous 3/0 or 4/0 absorbable
        over a fine feeding tube which you have inserted into the
        proximal and distal ends of the divided ureter. If you can
        perform a cystoscopy, you will be able to withdraw the
        feeding tube after 10days. If not, make a small cystostomy
        and find the distal end of the tube: <i>do not pull on it!</i> Attach
        its distal end through the eye of a Foley catheter that you
        have placed in the bladder. You can then remove the
        feeding tube simply by removing the catheter</p>
    <p>Otherwise, fix the feeding tube in place in the proximal
        ureter, and lead the other end of the tube out of the
        abdomen through a separate stab incision, and allow urine
        to collect in a sealed bag. This will preserve kidney
        function till you can refer the patient for ureteric
        re-implantation later. Place a tube drain into the abdomen.</p>
    <p><b>If you open the bladder,</b> repair it in at least 2 layers with
        long-acting absorbable. Leave a catheter in for 10days.
        The tear is likely to heal uneventfully.</p>
    <p><b>If you have injured the colon,</b> repair the tear in 2 layers.
        Fashion a defunctioning colostomy if there is severe
        soiling, or if there is severe scarring, and you are uncertain
        of the reliability of your closure.</p>
    <p><b>If there is bleeding at the end of the operation,</b>
        try packing the pelvis with warm packs and tie off any
        arterial bleeding vessels. If this fails, <i>don't close the
        vaginal vault</i>. Instead, insert a purse string suture in the
        vaginal vault around a tube drain and pull it tight.
        This will leave a central hole in the vagina through which
        any fluid can escape.</p>
    <p id="laparoscopicTechnique"><b>If there is postoperative retention of urine,</b> it is likely to
        be due to detrusor failure, and to be difficult to treat.
        First of all, make sure urine is being produced.
        Try 4wks of catheter drainage and urethral dilatation.
        If this fails, teach intermittent self-catheterization,
        which is effective and safe. Use a clean but not sterile
        simple plastic catheter, which she can use for at least a
        week. <i>A retentive bladder is much more comfortable than
        a leaky one, and easier to manage.</i></p>
