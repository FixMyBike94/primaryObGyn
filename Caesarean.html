    <h1>Caesarean Section</h1>
    <h2 id="kind">Which Kind of Caesarean Section?</h2>
    <p>Caesarean Section is the commonest emergency procedure
        after episiotomy and evacuation of retained products of
        conception carried out in a district hospital. If you are
        inexperienced it will also be the one which you will be most
        frightened of doing. In unskilled hands it is often fatal,
        as a result of:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>anaesthetic-related problems such as obstruction of the
            upper airways and the inhalation of gastric contents, spinal
            shock or ventilatory paralysis and overdose,</li>
        <li>haemorrhage, often related to inexperience or technical
            problems after earlier operations,</li>
        <li>sepsis.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are several methods of Caesarean Section:</p>
    <p>(1) Lower segment, through a transverse incision (21.10).<br>
        It has long been the standard operation because:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>a scar here ruptures 10 times less often than the scar
        from a classical incision,</li>
        <li>when it does rupture it does so less dangerously,</li>
        <li>the incision in the uterus heals better,</li>
        <li>the danger of spreading infection is reduced,</li>
        <li>the placenta is less often directly underneath the uterine
        incision,</li>
        <li>the bowel is less likely to stick to the scar in the uterus,</li>
        <li>there are fewer postoperative complications.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are still some problems, though:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>A lower segment operation needs more skill.</li>
        <li>It is still dangerous if there is intrauterine infection,
       although less so than the classical incision.</li>
        <li>You may injure the bladder.</li>
        <li>Bleeding from the ends of the incision is more difficult
       to control, especially if there are lateral extension tears,
       as may happen if the lower segment is thin and distended,
       or the foetus is an awkward position, as in a transverse lie.
       These tears may bleed severely, and in trying to control
       bleeding you may tie or cut the ureters.</li>
        <li>You may find it difficult to extract a distorted
       presenting part through a lower segment incision, and tear
       the uterus as you do. This tear will be dangerous, and the
       only way to avoid such, is to extend it. If you can do this
       curving the incision upwards at the edges, well and good;
       otherwise you may have to resort to a T incision, which does
       not heal well, and is a very bad incision to have to make.
       So only make the standard transverse incision if it is safe.</li>
        <li>The risk of spontaneous rupture is low, but not
       insignificant, at 1%.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Because of these dangers, we describe 5 other methods:<br>
        (2) Transverse classical, through a transverse incision low
        in the upper segment. This is occasionally needed if there is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>a transverse lie,</li>
            <li>a contraction (Bandl's) ring,</li>
            <li>a very vascular lower segment, with many thick veins,</li>
            <li>a placenta praevia (20.11),</li>
            <li>a poorly developed lower segment especially if it is a
        premature delivery, or</li>
            <li>a uterus which is a mass of fibroids in its lower part.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>(3) Midline classical, through a vertical incision in the
        upper segment (21.12). This is really only indicated, then
        rarely, if:</p>
    <ol>
         <li>the lower 1/2 of the upper segment which is very
        vascular, or inaccessible as a result of adhesions from
        previous surgery,</li>
        <li>a previous classical incision has healed poorly,</li>
        <li>you will proceed to hysterectomy anyway,</li>
        <li>in the rare case of post-mortem delivery.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>N.B. You should combine a classical incision with a tubal
        ligation unless there is a very good reason not to, because
        uterine rupture may occur spontaneously in pregnancy and
        occurs in up to 10% of all cases.</i></p>
    <p>(4) De Lee (Kronig or Cornell), through a vertical incision,
        2/3 in the lower segment, and 1/3 in the upper. Use this if:</p>
    <ol>
         <li>a lateral tear is likely, as can happen if the lower
        segment is very thin,</li>
        <li>the foetus is in an abnormal position, e.g. transverse lie,
        especially if the foetal back is presenting.</li>
    </ol>
         <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>N.B. It is difficult often to know where the lower segment
        ends and the upper segment starts, so a De Lee may actually
        become a midline classical incision. Risk of spontaneous
        rupture is up to 5%.</i></p>
    <p>(5) Extraperitoneal, by excluding the peritoneal cavity
        from passage of the foetus. This greatly reduces the impact
        of infection as septic fluids are prevented from entering the
        peritoneal cavity.</p>
    <p>(6) With hysterectomy. Indicated occasionally for:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>rupture of the uterus (21.17),</li>
        <li>severe bruising of the lower segment,</li>
        <li>laceration of the uterine artery,</li>
        <li>established uterine infection,</li>
        <li>severe placenta accreta after previous Caesarean
       Sections,</li>
        <li>early proven cervical carcinoma
        (N.B. you can easily confuse this macroscopically with
       cervical schistosomiasis).</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="#lowerSegment">Lower segment Caesarean Section</h2>
    <p>Experienced surgeons often use a Pfannenstiel or JoelCohen abdominal wall incision for a Caesarean Section.
        This is justified if this will be the patient&#39;s last Caesarean
        Section, or is combined with a tubal ligation, or if she will
        have access to equally experienced surgeons in the future.
        Otherwise there are further problems: the surgeon who will
        perform the next Caesarean Section may not be experienced,
        and may not be able to cope with adhesions behind a
        Pfannenstiel incision, likely especially after infection or
        keloid formation: this can be very difficult. A lower midline
        incision is safer if future circumstances are uncertain.</p>
    <p>PREOPERATIVE COUNSELLING.<br>
        Always think of discussing with the patient the advisability
        of performing a simultaneous tubal ligation. Indications are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>>1 previous Caesarean Section. </li>
        <li>Parity >2.</li>
        <li>>30yrs of age</li>
        <li>Hypertension, diabetes, sickle cell disease, or heart
            disease.</li>
        <li>Advanced or untreated HIV infection.</li>
        <li>Previous classical incision.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is always a good idea, especially in resource-poor
        countries, to discuss, preferably halfway during pregnancy,
        whether a parous pregnant woman would like a tubal
        ligation in case she needs a Caesarean Section. She then has
        time to think about it and discuss it with the relevant
        persons, and is not rushed into making a decision in an
        emergency. <i>A pre-printed questionnaire on her antenatal
        record will help remind staff and also make it routine.</i>
        This is important as patients must not feel the question is
        specifically directed at them, but that it is the routine to ask.</p>
    <p><small><i>WAMBUE (35yrs) had had 3 previous Caesarean Sections, and went into
        premature labour one evening. The duty doctor took her to the theatre.
        The lower segment was very vascular, and there were many adhesions from
        previous operations. When he incised it, he cut into a placenta praevia,
        which is normally not a problem but it is better to open the uterus with your
        fingers (and then it is easy to go through or past the placenta as long as you
        are quick). The operation was otherwise uneventful, the uterine incision
        was repaired, and all bleeding carefully controlled. He noted that the
        bladder was distended, but assumed that the catheter had come out. When
        she left the theatre the blood pressure was normal, and she was transfused
        one unit of blood. The urine was however noted to be bloodstained.
        He was summoned urgently to the ward 15mins later because she was lying
        in a pool of blood, with no pulse and a systolic blood pressure of 30mm Hg.
        The uterus was well contracted, she was given ergometrine, and rushed
        back to the theatre. She was resuscitated and the abdomen was reopened;
        there was no blood in it. She died on table. At postmortem she had a large
        tear in the bladder; the upper edge of the uterine incision had been
        mistakenly sutured to the upper margin of the anterior bladder tear, so that
        the lower edge of the uterus had been able to bleed freely into the bladder
        and vagina. The doctor was overcome by grief and felt very incompetent.
        LESSONS (1) The anatomy of a patient having a 4th Caesarean Section can
        be complicated. (2) <i>Do not make your incision too low, especially with a
        repeat Caesarean Section.</i> (3) If you find an abnormally adherent or
        vascular lower segment, perform a high transverse incision. (4) As so often,
        disaster was the result of the combination of risk factors. A lower segment,
        which has been the site of adherence of a placenta praevia, is apt to bleed
        postoperatively. Had she not also had a placenta praevia, she would
        probably have escaped with her life, and merely had a vesico-uterine fistula,
        which could have been repaired. (5) If you have to try to do your best in 20
        expert fields simultaneously (see the frontispiece), you will, by the
        standards of 20 experts, not be as competent as they are. You will inevitably
        meet tragedies of this kind, for which you cannot be blamed. You can but
        do your best.What is reprehensible is not to care, and not to strive to
        improve your standards. (6) A colleague in this condition needs support.</i></small></p>
    <p>ANTIBIOTICS halve the incidence of wound infection after
        Caesarean Section: use prophylactic pre-operative
        benzylpenicillin, chloramphenicol IV and metronidazole PR
        stat as soon as you make the decision to perform surgery.</p>
    <p><b>If you wait till the cord is clamped,</b> it is too late to help
        prevent foetal sepsis.</p>
    <p><b>If you have difficulty catheterizing the bladder before
        operating,</b> raise the foetal head with your hands. If you fail
        to pass a catheter on the first occasion, try again after the
        patient is anaesthetized, when pushing up the foetal head
        will be easier. If you have to operate with a full bladder,
        be very careful as you open the peritoneum. Open it as far
        cranially as you can, and empty the bladder with a long
        needle via the abdomen.</p>
    <p>Clip the hair where you intend to make the incision.
        (<i>Avoid shaving, which increases the risk of infection</i>).
        Prepare the skin of the lower abdomen (21-12B), drape the
        abdomen with 4 plain towels, and cover these with a towel
        with a slit (21-12C).</p>

    <p>PALESA (24yrs, Para 1) was taken to theatre because of a high head after
        pushing for 30mins. She had had a Caesarean Section before. In the old
        notes, it was recorded that the previous Caesarean Section was also for a
        high head during the 2nd stage and that this was surprisingly difficult
        because the head was so low. At arrival in theatre (20mins later) with all the
        theatre staff present just before the spinal anaesthetic, the gynaecologist
        smelled faeces. He re-examined the patient and found the head on the
        perineum. Encouraged by the enthusiastic staff, who normally only see
        babies born by Caesarean Section, it became an easy vaginal delivery.
        LESSON: use all your senses.</p>
    <p>ANAESTHESIA. You can use GA, Spinal anaesthesia,
        Ketamine or LA, or a combination. <i>Do not let the lack of an
        anaesthetist inhibit you in performing an emergency
        Caesarean Section.</i></p>
    <p>METHOD (GRADE 3.)<br>
        POSITION. Stand on the right side of the patient.
        Prevent the supine hypotensive syndrome (pressure on the
        vena cava) by tilting her about 5º to the left. Do this, either
        by tilting the table, or by putting a pillow or sandbag under
        the right buttock. Find some way of preventing her slipping
        off the table. A moderate head down (Trendelenburg)
        position, after the spinal anaesthetic is fixed at the correct
        level, will give you better access to the lower segment.
        It will make delivering the foetal head easier if there is a
        vertex presentation. It will also be an additional safeguard
        against vomiting.</p>
    <p>INCISION.<br>
        Make a cut through the skin and subcutaneous tissue down
        to the level of the rectus sheath (21-12D) from within 3cm
        of the umbilicus downwards, not beyond the upper limit of
        the pubic hair.<br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>N.B. Take care if there has been a previous Caesarean
        Section (21.14).</i><br>
        Separate the rectus (18-22B) and pyramidalis muscles,
        if present, in the midline as far as the symphysis.
        If necessary, extend the skin incision further down.
        A short downwards extension is more effective in improving
        access than an extension upwards.</p>
    <p> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>N.B. If you use a Pfannenstiel incision, use your fingers
        in a similar way for the tissues under the skin and above the
        fascia, even the fascia and also, now directed vertically,
        to separate the rectus muscle in the midline. This approach
        will push some nerves and blood vessels to the side instead
        of cutting them</i></p>
    <p>Use sharp and blunt dissection to expose the transversalis
        fascia and the peritoneum. Use two haemostats to pick up
        peritoneum near the upper end of the incision (21-12E).
        This is especially important if the labour is obstructed,
        and the bladder is displaced upwards. Feel the fold of
        peritoneum you have picked up, to make sure there is no
        bowel or bladder in it. Make a small opening in it with a
        scalpel (21-12F) or your finger, and then open the rest of it
        with scissors (21-12G) or tearing it with your fingers,
        longitudinally from above downwards to just above the
        reflection of the bladder.</p>
    <p>CAUTION! <b>If the patient has had a previous
        operation,</b> including a previous Caesarean Section,
        omentum or bowel may be adherent to the abdominal wall
        and can be easily damaged. If you cut the bowel by mistake,
        clamp it and close it later (11-5). If there have been several
        previous Caesarean Sections, the anatomy will be much
        distorted by adhesions.</p>
    <p>Clamp any active bleeding vessels if they are big,
        but postpone tying them until later in order to save time.
        They usually stop bleeding on their own anyway, although
        this does not always happen if you use a Pfannenstiel
        incision.</p>
    <p><i>Do not use diathermy until the foetus is delivered,</i>
        because the current may cause foetal cardiac dysrhythmias.Feel and observe the uterus to find how it is rotated,
        and identify the presenting part. It is usually rotated to the
        right, so that the left round ligament is usually more anterior
        and closer to the midline than the right. If the uterus is
        markedly rotated, turn it towards the midline.</p>
    <p><i>If you do not allow for rotation, you may cut the left uterine
        artery,</i> because your incision will be too far to the left.
        If you find that the left side of the incision always bleeds
        excessively, this is probably what you are doing wrong.</p>
    <p><b>If the foetal head is impacted in the pelvis</b> and needs to be
        disimpacted from below, ask yourself if a symphysiotomy
        (21.7) would not have been better, and remember this next
        time! Ask an assistant, with sterile gloves, to put his hand
        into the vagina, and to disimpact the foetal head. <i>He should
        do this before you incise the uterus.</i> If he waits until
        after you have incised it, the foetal shoulders may
        prolapse into the wound, and make delivery difficult.
        Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict that the head needs
        disimpaction, until after you have opened the uterus.</p>
    <p>Pick up the loose peritoneum of the vesico-uterine pouch
        with dissecting forceps (21-12H). Make a small cut in the
        peritoneum over the uterus, just below the point where the
        loose peritoneum becomes firmly attached to its anterior
        wall. This is the abdominal marking of the lower segment.
        Then tear the peritoneum with your fingers to left and right,
        so as to separate it from the uterus underneath: you are less
        likely to cut bowel at the lateral edges if you use fingers
        rather than scissors, and you can quickly free a large area of
        the uterus. (21-12I). As you reach the edges of the uterus,
        aim your fingers in a more cephalic direction, so that the tear
        in the peritoneum is curved (21-12J). Try to leave a bare
        area about 2cm wide and 12cm long. </p>
    <p> CAUTION!<br>
        (1) Take great care to avoid injuring the bladder, especially
        if this is pulled up high and is oedematous.<br>
        (2) Do not denude the lower segment for >5cm: if the cervix
        is effaced and dilated, you may enter the vagina by mistake.
        Put the Doyen's retractor over the bladder, to protect it for
        the rest of the operation.</p>
    <p>Place moist abdominal packs on either side of the uterus
        before opening it (21-12K), so as to prevent blood, liquor,
        and meconium from soiling the peritoneal cavity,
        and to keep the bowels out of the way. Meconium is irritant,
        and if it becomes infected peritonitis may follow.
        Attach artery forceps to the tapes of these packs, to prevent
        them being lost. <i>N.B. Never use small swabs!</i></p>
    <p>You may find it helpful to place a stay suture into the lower
        segment (21-12L), and hold it in a haemostat.</p>
    <p>Make a superficial incision over the full trajectory of the
        planned opening in the uterus, c.10cm long, with its ends
        curving gently upwards directed to the attachments of the
        round ligaments (the <q>smile</q> incision). This should be
        2 cm or less below the peritoneal reflection, and at least
        2 cm or more above the detached bladder.</p>
    <p><i>Do not make your transverse incision too low in the lower
        segment.</i> Place it where normally the empty bladder reflects
        (so not where a bladder pulled up by adhesions reflects) or
        1-2cm higher. Then go somewhat deeper in the midline
    <i>without at this stage entering the uterine cavity.</i></p>
    <p>To do this, push an index finger in the midline through the
        uterine wall and put the other index finger beside it and tear
        the uterus along the path of the superficial incision.
        This is easy. The not-so-neat edges of the arteries cut by
        fingers bleed less and the extent of the opening is easy to
        control. A major advantage is that you cannot in this way cut
        into the foetus and transfer HIV, HBV, or HCV.</p>
    <p><b>If the patient has had previous Caesarean Sections,
        and the uterus is very fibrotic,</b> you may have to extend the
        incision with scissors, curving it upwards laterally</p>
    <p> CAUTION!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The lower segment varies considerably in thickness.
        It is thick before labour and becomes thinner during labour,
        so be careful not to cut the foetus. Protect it with a finger
        between the membranes and the uterine wall if you use
        scissors instead of tearing with your fingers.</li>
        <li>Do not make the incision too small, or the uterus will tear
        as you remove the foetal head.</li>
        <li>If you decide to enlarge the incision, curve it upwards at
        its ends, so as to avoid the uterine vessels. Also, when you
        suture it, you will be less likely to suture the ureters.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>If there is a scar in the lower segment from a previous
        Caesarean Section,</b> make a shallow cut along it, where you
        want to open the rest of the uterus.</p>
    <p><b>If you can feel the foetal vertex through the uterine wall,</b>
        the placenta is probably lying in the fundus or posteriorly,
        so you can expect a delivery without difficulty.</p>
    <p><b>If you tear the placenta as you open the uterus,</b> try to
        detach it, and deliver the foetus around it. <i>Only tear through
        the placenta if you have to.</i> There can be severe bleeding
        from a lacerated placenta, so clamp the umbilical cord
        quickly (21.11).</p>
    <p><b>If the ends of the opening in the lower segment bleed
        severely,</b> before the foetus has been delivered, quickly
        proceed with delivery, and then control bleeding as
        described below.</p>
    <p><b>If there are large veins over the lower segment,</b>
        place your uterine incision towards or in the upper segment,
        or place clamps across the veins and incise the uterus
        precisely and carefully between the clamps, and deliver the
        foetus rapidly. The veins will probably stop bleeding soon
        after. If necessary, ligate the veins.</p>
    <p>DELIVERING THE BABY<br>
        Remove the Doyen's retractor. Put your finger (only) into
        the uterus under the baby's head to decompress a vacuum,
        and make it easier for the foetal head to rise in the incision.
        Then put your hand outside the lower flap of the incision,
        and lift the foetal head up (21-12P).</p>
    <p><b>If the incision is not long enough to deliver the foetus
        without a lateral tear,</b> extend its ends upwards and laterally
        with your fingers, so as to make a U-shaped flap.</p>
    <p>Now ask your assistant (or the anaesthetist groping under the
        drapes) to press on the fundus to assist delivery. He may
        have to press firmly, but carefully and without hurrying.</p>
    <p>CAUTION! <i>Do not try to aspirate the nose especially
        with a big Yankauer sucker:</i> it may push maternal blood into
        the nose and/or traumatise the nasal passages.</p>
    <p>ERGOMETRINE OR OXYTOCIN.<br>
        <i>If there is hypertension, or eclampsia, or you are operating
        under LA, avoid ergometrine,</i> and administer 5U oxytocin
        IV or IM. Ergometrine occasionally makes a conscious
        patient sick, and may raise the blood pressure. Because you
        are manipulating the uterus and can easily make sure it is
        empty (leaving placenta behind is embarrassing), the uterus
        is usually well contracted during closure. But after that you
        will often not notice relaxation because bleeding will not be
        overt. An oxytocin infusion at the end of the operation and
        the first postoperative hours can save lives.</p>
    <p>THE BABY.<br>
        <b>If there is placenta praevia,</b> clamp the cord quickly,
        because blood loss from the injured sinuses of the placenta
        may be significant. Otherwise delayed cord clamping,
        placing the baby below table level and milking the cord all
        serve to increase the Hb level of a neonate, especially if
        pre-term.</p>
    <p>CONTROLLING BLEEDING.<br>
        Now deliver the uterus by lifting the fundus out of the
        abdomen; it is easier then to see what you are doing</p>
    <p><b>If you are a quick operator,</b> apply one Green-Armytage
        clamp (or sponge-holding forceps) at one angle of the
        uterine opening, and start suturing at the opposite end.</p>
    <p><b>If you are a slow operator,</b> apply several Green-Armytage
        clamps (or sponge-holders) all round the cut edges of the
        uterus, particularly at the angles. <i>Make sure they do not
        grasp the posterior wall of the empty uterus, as it lies on the
        promontory of the sacrum;</i> you can easily do this by mistake
        if bleeding has been brisk. The difficulty in applying many
        clamps is that they will get in your way. <i>Do not pull on the
        clamps during suturing</i> as this will result in an asymmetric
        closure.</p>
    <p>REMOVING THE PLACENTA<br>
        When the uterus is contracting firmly, remove the placenta
        by a combination of controlled cord traction and fundal
        pressure (21-12S). If necessary, help it to contract
        by massaging the fundus from inside the abdomen.
        Pull gently on the cord, and press the uterus back with your
        left hand. This should deliver the placenta easily.</p>
    <p><b>If there is a placenta praevia grown into a previous
        Caesarean Section scar,</b> there is serious danger of serious
        blood loss at this stage.</p>
    <p>If you cannot remove the placenta manually (the practical
        definition of placenta accreta) then you may be forced to
        proceed to hysterectomy. While deciding or organising
        blood, apply a tourniquet round the cervix (22.11)</p>
    <p>When the placenta is delivered:<br>
        (1) Inspect the uterine cavity to make sure it is empty.
        Remove pieces of membrane.<br>
        (2) Make sure that the placenta is complete.<br>
         CAUTION! <i>Do not probe the cervix to improve drainage:
        keep out of the contaminated vagina!</i></p>
    <p>CLOSING THE UTERUS<br>
        Do this in 2 layers using #1 long-acting absorbable sutures
        on a large round-bodied Mayo's needle. <i>Do not use nonabsorbable sutures, particularly not on the inner wall.</i>
        Ask your assistant to hold the lower edge of the uterus
        forwards, while you suture from the angles inwards
        (21-12T). Start the first sutures just beyond the lateral
        extremity of the wound. Knot with good tension and protect
        the point of your needle with the needle holder; then start
        with a different suture and needle holder just beyond the
        other lateral extremity, make a similar knot and work
        towards the first knot, and tie this second suture to the short
        end of the first. Then re-start with the first suture and
        continue in the opposite direction (21-12U), finally knotting
        this to the short end of the second suture. In this way,
        you secure the angles first. You will, if you use 90cm
        sutures, have at least enough material left to tie the tubes
        (if desired), and the rectus sheath.<br>
        <i>Unless the sutures are tight, they will not stop the bleeding.</i></p>
    <p> CAUTION!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start suturing just lateral to the wound extremity with an
            adequate bite through the whole uterine wall.</li>
        <li><i>Do not suture the lower edge above the upper one,</i>
            because this may advance the bladder up the uterus. </li>
        <li><i>Do not include the bladder in your sutures.</i> If you find at
            the end of your closure, that you have included it,
            you will probably be wise to leave a catheter in for a few
            days, rather than removing the sutures and starting again,
            which can cause severe bleeding.</li>
        <li><i>Do not suture too deeply with a large needle at the
            angles of incision;</i> you may obstruct the ureters. </li>
        <li><i>Do not suture the front and back walls of the uterus
            together.</i> So, before the first layer of sutures is completed,
            put two fingers into the uterine cavity, to make sure that its
            walls are free. If necessary, release the sutures and start
            again. </li>
        <li><i>Do not suture the bowel to the back of the broad
            ligament.</i> Suture only the uterus, and not too deeply
            downwards towards the vault of the vagina. If you are in any
            doubt, put your fingers down behind the uterus before you
            start to close the lateral extremities of the opening so that the
            peritoneum stays out of your suture.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When the uterus is no longer bleeding, close the peritoneum
        of the vesico-uterine pouch with continuous sutures of
        non-absorbable (21-12V). <i>Again avoid including the bladder
        with the lower edge of the peritoneum.</i></p>
    <p>COMPLETING THE REPAIR<br>
        Look carefully at your completed repair. If there is still
        bleeding, put in some more 'figure of 8' sutures at the
        bleeding points. <i>Do not close the peritoneum until you have
        controlled all bleeding,</i> but minimal oozing is allowed.</p>
    <p><b>If you find an ovarian cyst >5cm diameter,</b> perforate it,
        unless it is very large (23.9)<br>
        <b>Now is the time to tie the tubes (19.4).</b> The Fallopian tubes
        in pregnancy are swollen; do not use rings or Filshie clips
        on them: they tend to slip off or break and are costly!</p>
    <p>CLOSING THE ABDOMEN<br>
        Clean all blood and debris from the peritoneal cavity,
        and especially from the paracolic gutters. They will be much
        cleaner if you have previously inserted abdominal packs
        beside the uterus (21-12K). Wash out the abdominal cavity
        with copious warm water if there was soiling present.
        Replace the uterus if you have exteriorized it. Place the
        greater omentum over the uterus: it will usually reach the
        bladder. Close the abdomen (11.8). <i>Do not insert a drain.</i></p>
    <p>BONDING<br>
        As soon as the mother has delivered, after any necessary
        resuscitation, give her the baby to hold. This close early
        contact is important in developing the bond between them.
        If she has had a GA, place the baby in a cot beside her,
        so she can see her child when she wakes up.</p>
    <p>POSTOPERATIVE CARE AFTER CAESAREAN SECTION<br>
        Estimate the blood loss: it will probably be more than you
        think, but if the membranes were intact, some of the liquid
        will be liquor. The average loss is 1l. Unless you have expert
        staff, check the vital signs yourself. Check and chart the
        pulse, temperature, and respiration 1/2hrly, until she is awake,
        and then, when the condition is satisfactory, hourly for
        12-24hrs. Continue an IV infusion for 24hrs; start oral fluids
        as soon as she is fully awake. <i>Do not forget analgesia.</i> It is
        wise to administer oxytocin 20U in 1l IV over 6hrs
        post-operatively to ensure good contraction of the uterus.
        It is worthwhile making a postpartum vaginal examination:
        you will instantly diagnose a urinary leak, if present.
        <b>If bleeding was excessive,</b> make sure there are 2 cannulae in
        situ and IV saline or Ringer&#39;s lactate fluid replacement
        is flowing nicely. Review the patient yourself in 1hr.
        You will be surprised how often a patient who left the
        theatre in reasonable condition is now collapsed.</p>
    <p>CAUTION! Look for signs of infection:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fever.</li>
        <li>A large, soft, tender uterus.</li>
        <li>Tender thickening in the lateral fornices.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>If the membranes were ruptured for >24hrs before the
        operation,</b> or there are other reasons for suspecting
        infection, continue antibiotics for 3days.<br>
        <i>N.B. Do not use antibiotics routinely postop.</i></p>
    <p><b>If vomiting ensues with abdominal distension,</b>
        insert a nasogastric tube</p>
    <p> CAUTION! Before the patient goes home, make sure that
        she and her relatives know that future deliveries must occur
        in hospital: <i>this is ESSENTIAL!</i> When next pregnant, she
        must attend regularly for antenatal care. Give her a card
        which explains why Caesarean Section was done,
        or add these details to the baby&#39;s birth card.</p>
    <p><b>If there was obstructed labour and the urine is
        bloodstained,</b> leave a catheter in the bladder for 10days.</p>
    <h2 id="difficulties">Difficulties with Caesarean Section</h2>
    <p>Many difficulties attend Caesarean Section, and many
        disasters can follow it, so the list below is long. <i>Torrential
        bleeding when you cut through a placenta praevia can kill a
        woman quickly. Disasters with the urinary tract are usually
        the result of very poor technique.</i> Fortunately, most of the
        other problems are rare. Some of the many difficulties are
        only seen in poor resource settings, where inexpert operators
        find themselves working under difficult circumstances.</p>
    <p>DIFFICULTIES WITH THE INCISION<br>
        <b>If a patient has had a previous Caesarean Section,</b>
        dense adhesions may have formed between the uterus and
        the abdominal wall. </p>
    <p><i>Do not excise a keloid scar:</i> the keloid will probably get
        bigger. Just go through the middle of it. Excise redundant
        skin if you intend simultaneously to repair an incisional
        hernia (18.13). If the sides of the abdominal wall might
        prove difficult to line up accurately, mark a transverse line
        before your incision and align the points later.</p>
    <p>Open the parietal peritoneum beyond the end of the previous
        scar. If you find a plane of loose connective tissue,
        free it with a finger. Cut fibrous bands. If dissecting the
        adhesions is very difficult (unusual), give up and make an
        upper segment incision.</p>
    <p> CAUTION!<br>
        (1) Stay close to the uterus to avoid the bladder.<br>
        (2) If you find it helpful, open the uterus between stay
        sutures.</p>
    <p><b>If she has had a previous classical Caesarean Section,</b>
        you would probably be wiser to perform a lower segment
        operation this time.</p>
    <p><b>If the bladder has stuck to the lower segment,</b>
        so you separate them with a finger, incise the peritoneum on
        the uterus about 2cm above the bladder. Lift the lower edge
        in forceps to stretch the adhesions between the bladder and
        the uterus. Cut them close to the uterus, keeping the points
        of the scissors directed at it. If this is difficult, give up and
        make an incision c.3cm above the area where the bladder
        and the uterus have stuck together.</p>
    <p><b>If the incision in the uterus tears</b> as you extract the foetal
        head, there will probably be a vertical tear in the corner
        which will run down behind the bladder, often with heavy
        bleeding. If you are alone with the scrub nurse, ask for an
        extra assistant. Exteriorize the uterus by drawing it out of the
        abdomen. Identify the edges of the incision and the tear.
        Mobilize the bladder further downwards if necessary.</p>
    <p><b>If you cannot define the extent of the tear,</b> carefully open
        the broad ligament by cutting the round ligament (21-18).
        This will let you feel the ureter, so that you can avoid it
        before you apply any clamps. Now apply Green-Armytage
        forceps to the edges of the tear, and draw its angle into view.
        Apply direct pressure with a dry pack, find the bleeding
        vessels, and tie them. Use interrupted sutures in the area of
        the tear. These will be easier to unpick if you find you have
        caught the bladder or the ureter by mistake.</p>
    <p> CAUTION! <i>So, after repairing a tear, check visually that
        the ureter has not been caught in a stitch by mistake. If you
        have a doubt, inject dye into the ureter to see if it leaks.</i><br>
        <b>If these measures fail,</b> the only way to control bleeding
        may be to tie the both uterine arteries, just after they
        have entered or branched into the uterus or cervix.
        If you are not able to repair the uterus, perform a subtotal
        hysterectomy (21.17).</p>
    <p>DIFFICULTIES WITH PARTICULAR PRESENTATIONS<br>
        <b>If there is obstructed labour with a cephalic
        presentation,</b> enter the abdomen just below the umbilicus so
        as to avoid the bladder. If catheterization before the
        operation was impossible, empty the bladder now with a
        needle and syringe. Much of the swelling will be oedema,
        which will not go away. Mobilize the bladder free from the
        lower segment as usual. If necessary, get an assistant now to
        push the foetal head up from below through the vagina,
        before you open the uterus. Otherwise, the foetal shoulder
        may prolapse into the incision and make delivery more
        difficult. Make a transverse incision in the lower segment.
        Choose its level carefully. If it is too high, delivery will be
        difficult; if it is too low, you may have technical difficulties
        closing the vagina or you may even incise the vagina.</p>
    <p><b>If delivering the head is difficult,</b> do not panic.
        Everyone finds this a problem, especially when the uterus is
        tight around it. Take time to push the uterine wall back
        from around the head, by inserting 2 fingers all round.
        If you still have difficulty, enlarge the wound curving
        upwards laterally.</p>
    <p> CAUTION!<br>
        (1) <i>Do not lever the head out with your whole hand,</i> because
        this can cause vertical downward tears in the lower segment.<br>
        (2) If the liquor was purulent or infected, clean the abdomen
        carefully, and wash out the pelvis with warm saline.
        Administer antibiotics for at least 5days.</p>
    <p><b>If there is a breech presentation,</b> feel for a leg, or better,
        both legs, and deliver the foetus breech-first as if you
        were delivering the head. Then deliver the head slowly,
        or you may damage it.<br>
        If, by mistake, you take hold of an arm, replace it.
        Then feel for a leg; recognize it by feeling for the heel.
        If an arm comes out and will not go back, you are in trouble:
        you may have to make an inverted 'T' incision to get the
        foetus out.<br>
        When necessary, deliver the head (22.7) by a modified
        Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit manoeuvre, and the arms by
        pressure on the upper arms which you feel by palpating the
        back, or by a modified Lovset manoeuvre.</p>
    <p><b>If there is a transverse lie,</b> the choice of incision is
        important. (21.9).<br>
        (1) <b>If the mother is in early labour, and the lower
        segment is poorly developed,</b> with most of the baby in the
        upper segment, make a transverse incision in the upper
        segment and deliver the foetus by breech extraction (22.7).<br>
        (2) <b>If early labour has begun, the lower segment is
        well developed, and the membranes are still intact,</b>
        make a transverse incision in the lower segment, and deliver
        the foetus by breech extraction.<br>
        (3) <b>If labour is obstructed, and most of the foetus is in the
        overdistended lower segment,</b> simple delivery through a
        transverse incision in the lower segment will cause large
        tears. So, if the foetus is alive, make a vertical incision in the
        lower segment, and extend the incision into the upper
        segment until it is big enough to effect delivery.<br>
        (4) <b>If the foetus is dead,</b> try to avoid opening the uterus.
        Only make a transverse incision in the lower segment as a
        last resort and decapitate or eviscerate the dead foetus in
        order to deliver it in any convenient way (21.8).<br>
         CAUTION! <i>Do not try to deliver a dead impacted foetus
        intact,</i> because this will tear the lower segment severely.
        <i>Do not make a classical or inverted 'T' incision for a dead
        foetus.</i></p>
    <p>DIFFICULTIES WITH THE PLACENTA<br>
        <b>If you anticipate placenta praevia,</b> expect difficulty,
        and get help if you can. You can usually use the ordinary
        transverse lower segment incision. <i>This is, however,
        contraindicated if:</i><br>
        (1) there is a poorly developed lower segment, which would
        not allow a transverse incision of adequate length.<br>
        (2) there is a very vascular lower segment with large veins
        on it: this might be a placenta accreta.<br>
        (3) the presenting part is high, and the foetus is lying
        transversely, indicating that the placenta praevia is probably
        central. If so, mobilize the utero-vesical fold, as for a lower
        segment operation. Make a low vertical midline or a
        transverse incision in the upper segment.</p>
    <p><b>If you find placenta in the incision:</b><br>
        (1) Peel it away from the uterine wall and enter the uterus
        from above it.<br>
        (2) When the edge of the placenta is too far away to allow
        this, push your finger through it quickly, and deliver the
        foetus without delay through the hole that you have just
        made. If you meet the cord, clamp it before you deliver the
        foetus, but <i>do not waste time looking for it:</i> you can clamp it
        immediately afterwards. Remember that a baby can easily
        bleed from an injured placenta. The mother can also bleed,
        so if you see a large bleeding vessel in the placental bed,
        control it with a figure-of-8 suture.<br>
        <i>Beware of a placenta praevia after a previous Caesarean
        Section:</i> it might very well be a placenta accreta, increta or
        percreta. If you can’t get the placenta off the uterine wall in
        this situation, you have confirmed the diagnosis and should
        proceed directly to a hysterectomy.<br>
         N.B. If, beforehand, a referral is possible to specialists
        where there is a reliable blood bank, that would be best.</p>
    <p><b>If there is postoperative bleeding</b> (not uncommon with the
        common type of placenta praevia), bleeding is probably
        arising from the lower segment at the site of the attachment
        of the placenta. Administer oxytocin, and if necessary
        transfuse blood. In desperation, pack the uterus (22.11)
        using a condom in the uterus, attached to an infusion to fill it
        as a balloon</p>
    <p><b>If there is severe vaginal bleeding 8-14days after delivery
        (SECONDARY PPH), the operation site is infected
        (common after an obstructed labour with sloughing of the
        tissues) or a piece of placenta was left behind,</b>
        under peri-operative antibiotic cover, take the patient back to
        theatre, and examine her under GA. Put a gloved finger into
        the uterus through the external os and feel for a piece of
        retained placenta, and for the inner wall of the uterine scar.
        If this feels weak, or has broken down, reopen the
        abdominal incision. You may find, especially in the
        presence of HIV infection, a soft necrotic bleeding uterus,
        with blood and spreading infection in the peritoneal cavity.
        What was the scar may now be an infected hole in the
        uterus. Under such circumstances perform a subtotal
        hysterectomy (21.17). <i>If you do not attempt this, she will die.</i>
        Expect to find that the parametrium is acutely infected and
        swollen, so that it feels like cheese. In this situation treat the
        patient for septic shock with much IV fluids and broadspectrum antibiotics.</p>
    <p>DIFFICULTIES WITH THE URINARY TRACT<br>
        <b>If you notice that you have opened the bladder,</b>
        which is not often detected during the operation, identify the
        hole carefully, hold its edges with Allis forceps, mobilize the
        surrounding tissues if necessary, and bring its edges together
        with continuous inverting sutures of 2/0 or 3/0 long-acting
        absorbable. Drain the bladder continuously with an
        indwelling catheter for 14days.</p>
    <p><b>If you have injured the ureter</b> at operation, first check that
        the other ureter is intact. Either, repair the damage if you can
        with 4/0 interrupted long-acting absorbable. Or, insert a fine
        T-shaped tube into the ureter, bringing out the ‘leg of the T’
        to the abdominal wall, and close the abdomen. Later, refer
        the patient for expert help. <i>Do not fashion an external
        ureterostomy,</i> as this will stenose.</p>
    <p><b>If there is anuria:</b>
        (1) This may be the result of severe hypotension,
        while the patient was in obstructed labour (not uncommon)
        or the result of pre-eclampsia. Hydrate the patient well and
        add IV furosemide 40mg.
        (2) Both ureters may have been tied or damaged.
        This you will find out usually the day after the operation.
        Perform an ultrasound to look for hydronephrosis.
        If you think you have tied one ureter or both, re-open the
        abdomen. For each side, check if the ureters are patent by
        injecting blue dye proximally. If no dye comes out in a
        urinary catheter, remove the uterine sutures one by one.
        Then close the uterus again. Otherwise refer the patient for
        reconstruction; if you cannot, except after considerable
        delay, fashion bilateral temporary nephrostomies (27.14).</p>
    <p><b>If there is a severe dull pain in one loin postoperatively,</b>
        you may have tied one of the ureters. Proceed as above.
        Otherwise refer the patient as before.
         N.B. Sometimes, when the ureter is damaged, neither the
        patient nor you are aware of it: the kidney merely stops
        functioning.</p>
    <p><b>If urine discharges from the vagina after 2-5days,</b>
        there might be:<br>
        (1) Overflow incontinence. Check if the bladder is
        distended. This can happen if there is bladder atony due to
        stretching of the detrusor muscle fibres. Keep in an
        indwelling (not a condom) catheter for 4wks.
        Expect complete recovery.<br>
        (2) Bladder or urethral stress incontinence. Ask the patient
        to cough: you will see urine spurting out of the urethra.
        If it is disabling, refer her for a colpo-suspension.<br>
        (3) A fistula. Pass a Foley catheter and perform a dye-test by
        instilling methylene blue in the bladder.
         <i>N.B. Not all urinary leakage postpartum is due to a
        fistula!</i></p>
    <p>(A) <b>If the test is +ve, the dye comes out from the anterior
        vaginal wall</b> (juxta-urethral, 21-20A or mid-vaginal VVF,
        21-20C) or the cervix (juxta- or intra-cervical VVF,
        21-20E,F). The first is due to pressure from the foetal head
        during prolonged obstructed labour. The last is the result of
        cutting the bladder or stitching the bladder together with the
        lower uterine segment during a Caesarean Section.<br>
        <i>Do not prescribe antibiotics (they are of no use) and do not
        send the patient away for evaluation in 3months’ time!</i><br>
        Contrary to general belief, a great deal can be and should be
        done immediately by very simple measures under any
        conditions, however deprived of resources, by whoever is
        involved in postpartum care. The principle is to decompress
        the bladder totally for a sufficiently long time to give it the
        opportunity to heal spontaneously as the fresh wound edges
        lie against each other. The earlier you do this the better the
        chance. Some 25-30% of fistulae will heal spontaneously in
        this way and larger fistulae will reduce to half the size.
        It is still worthwhile trying with fistula presenting up to
        3months postpartum. Open drainage of the catheter into a
        pot or a plastic bowl is often better than closed drainage into
        a urine bag, which is often carried on the head or shoulder!
        Therefore it is good to fix an IV giving set to the catheter to
        allow the patient free mobility.<br>
        There should be free drainage at all times: instruct the
        patient to take care not to block the catheter or to lie upon it
        when she sleeps.<br>
        In all cases keep a sufficiently large (Ch18) indwelling
        catheter in situ for at least 4-6wks, filling its balloon with a
        maximum of 10ml water. Encourage the patient to drink at
        least 5l fluids daily in order to produce a minimum of
        4l urine/day: the urine should be completely colourless and
        odourless like clear water. If she does not drink enough and
        the catheter gets blocked, flush it or change it for another.
        <i>Do not allow it to get blocked or infected!</i><br>
        Early on, sitz baths bd are useful, to prevent leaking urine
        irritating the skin. Remove any necrotic tissue from the
        vagina.<br>
        Support the patient with haematinics, and a high-protein
        diet. Insist on immediate mobilization: <i>it is a catastrophe to
        develop contractures and bedsores because of a fistula.</i><br>
        For the first few days the patient should stay in the hospital
        under close supervision to monitor her and to instruct her
        properly in catheter care and drinking. Then when her
        general condition is satisfactory she can be treated as an
        outpatient. She should come every week to report on the
        leak and to be instructed again to drink as much as 5l/day.<br>
        After removal of the catheter, instruct the patient to continue
        drinking and to pass urine frequently. She has to refrain
        from sexual intercourse for 4-6months. She must attend
        antenatal care at subsequent pregnancies and to deliver in a
        hospital at all subsequent deliveries.</p>
    <p><b>If after 6wks of catheterization, the urine still leaks all
        the time</b> (<i>i.e. not dry at night</i>), and upon vaginal
        examination the fistula is too big or the balloon is inside the
        fistula, remove the catheter and try to refer the patient to a
        hospital, where fistula-repair is done regularly: <i>the first
        attempt gives the best result.</i> If referral is impossible, you
        may be justified to attempt repair of simple fistulae (21.18)</p>
    <p>(B) <b>If the dye-test is -ve,</b> there might be a leak from a
        uretero-vaginal fistula. To confirm this, do the 3 swab test:
        put 3 pieces of cotton wool in the vagina, instil methylene
        blue through the catheter and let the patient walk around for
        20mins. After that remove the cotton swabs one by one.<br>
        (1) If the first swab is blue, there is urethral incompetence or
        a urethro-vaginal fistula.<br>
        (2) If the middle gauze is blue there is a vesico-vaginal
        fistula<br>
        (3) If the last gauze is blue there is a vesico-cervical or
        vesico-uterine fistula.<br>
        (4) If the last gauze is wet but not blue, there is a ureteric
        fistula. This type of fistula is probably caused by damage to
        the ureter at Caesarean Section or hysterectomy by:<br>
        (a) clamping it in error, not recognizing this, and leaving
        the clamp on for more than a few minutes, or<br>
        (b) by including the ureter in a suture whilst closing the
        uterine opening. An IVU will tell you which side is
        involved.<br>
        The kidney on the affected side will show some degree of
        hydronephrosis. The left side is almost twice as often
        damaged as the right side. There may or may not be pain in
        the loin. A uretero-vaginal fistula has a better prognosis and
        is less urgent than tied ureters, because it means that the
        kidneys will not stop functioning. Try to refer for elective
        repair: the ureter may need reimplanting into the bladder,
        or repair end to end. To maintain good kidney function, refer
        without delay.</p>
    <p><b>If there is a contraction (Bandl’s) ring</b> in the lower
        segment, or between the lower and the upper segments,
        deal with it like this: If the foetus is entirely above the ring,
        make a transverse incision entirely above it. If it is round the
        neck, make a vertical incision across it.</p>
    <p><b>If there are uterine fibroids,</b> leave them unless they are
        pedunculated and removal is very easy. In this case, make a
        V-shaped incision, not a straight transection, so that closing
        the uterine surface is possible without tension. Otherwise,
        leave them: they may settle and atrophy. Removing a
        fibroid, at delivery, from within the wall of the uterus,
        causes severe bleeding.</p>
    <p><b>If there are ovarian cysts or tumours,</b> remove them if they
        are >5cm diameter. Ovarian cystectomy is possible, but
        removing the ovary and tube will be quicker and safer.
        Smaller functional luteal cysts will have usually disappeared
        spontaneously by the end of pregnancy.</p>
    <p><b>If there are dense adhesions,</b> you will have to separate
        them sufficiently to get good access to the uterus. <i>Do not try
        to remove them from around the tubes and ovaries;</i> they will
        ooze and form again.</p>
    <h2 id="alternativeMethods">Alternative methods of
        Caesarean Section</h2>
    <p>TRANSVERSE CLASSICAL IN THE UPPER SEGMENT.<br>
        Check that the uterus is wide enough. Incise the peritoneum
        over the lower part of its upper segment with a scalpel.
        Mobilize it away from the incision with scissors, and incise
        the uterus transversely in the midline. Enlarge the incision to
        the right and left, by stretching it with your fingers
        (it is usually too thick to be cut with scissors), and deliver
        the baby by breech extraction.</p>
    <p>MIDLINE CLASSICAL IN THE UPPER SEGMENT.<br>
        The midline classical Caesarean Section is seldom done by
        experienced obstetricians. Because rupture of the uterus is
        such a danger with subsequent pregnancies, perhaps as early
        as 28wks, you must close the uterus with particular care, and
        do all you can to persuade the patient to consent to a
        simultaneous tubal ligation. Many steps are similar to those
        for a lower segment operation. However, the uterus is much
        thicker in the upper than in the lower segment, so you will
        have difficulty opening it using your fingers only.
        Make a 12cm vertical midline incision: <i>check carefully that
        the uterus is not rotated, before cutting!</i></p>

    <p>DE LEE (KRONIG/CORNELL) VERTICAL <br>
        IN 2/3 OF THE LOWER & 1/3 OF THE UPPER SEGMENT.<br>
        To make a de Lee incision, incise the visceral peritoneum
        transversely, as described below but high on the lower
        segment. Mobilize the peritoneum and the bladder well
        down. Find the midline of the uterus. Insert a small
        transverse suture where the bottom end of your incision is
        going to be, to prevent it extending downwards behind the
        bladder. Make a longitudinal incision, two-thirds of it in the
        lower segment, and one-third in the upper segment.</p>
    <p>Later, repair a de Lee incision with two layers of continuous
        #1 or #2 absorbable. Do not catch the full thickness of the
        uterine wall in the first layer: it is often too thick.
        Make sure you include the uterine fascia in the second layer,
        or it will continue to bleed. Repair the peritoneum and pull it
        up high, so that the top of the incision is covered, preferably
        with a locking suture (4-8G).</p>
    <p>If you have made a long cut in the upper segment, tie the
        tubes on the same indications as in a classical Caesarean
        Section.</p>

    <p>MODIFIED EXTRAPERITONEAL</p>
        <p>This method has undergone a renaissance, being
        recommended not so much where antibiotics are absent,
        but where infection is rife. The idea is that the foetus,
        on its way out of the uterus, does not pass through, and
        so does not contaminate the peritoneal cavity (21-14).</p>
    <p>Separate the parietal peritoneum from the rectus muscle
        down to the level of the dome of the bladder, and cut it open
        transversely to its lateral limits. Similarly cut open
        transversely the utero-vesical fold.
        Then suture the superior leaves of the parietal peritoneum
        and of the utero-vesical fold together, thus sealing off the
        peritoneal cavity from the lower uterine segment, before you
        actually open this. <i>Do not exteriorize the uterus!</i></p>
    <h2 id="infections">Infection following Caesarean Section</h2>
    <p>Peritonitis (10.1) may follow any obstructed labour,
        or an infected Caesarean Section, and is common after
        rupture of the uterus. Death is a real risk when:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>labour is abnormally long: the longer, the greater the
            risk,</li>
        <li>the foetus is dead,</li>
        <li>membranes rupture early and liquor becomes infected,</li>
        <li>HIV infection, is present</li>
        <li>sterile procedures are poor.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Use pre-operative antibiotics and proper sterile practice to
        try to prevent sepsis (2.7).</p>
    <p>INFECTION may take the following forms:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wound infection (11.13) may discharge through the scar
        into the cavity of the uterus. Infection may resolve, or you
        may need to drain pus suprapubically. If fever recurs with
        signs of more pus collecting, do another drainage operation.</li>
        <li>Pelvic abscess (10.3), which will need draining
        suprapubically or via a grid-iron incision</li>
        <li>Peritonitis (10.1): You will probably find that the uterus
        is totally disrupted, so it is hopeless to try to repair it.
        A subtotal hysterectomy (21.17) will usually be enough,
        commonly with the removal of both adnexa, but retain one if
        you can.</li>
        <li>Subphrenic abscess (10.10), which is a common late
        complication, and is likely to kill the patient if you do not
        drain it; as may multiple abscesses between loops of the
        bowel (10.3).</li>
        <li>Secondary postpartum haemorrhage (22.11,12) may
        occur with a retained segment of placenta, needing
        evacuation, or an infected uterine scar which will mean a
        hysterectomy (21.17).</li>
        <li>Burst abdomen (11.14) occurs especially after several
        Caesarean Sections, and needs repair.</li>
        <li>Infertility (19.3) is a late complication of infection.</li>
        <li>Bowel obstruction and low-grade peritonitis will occur if
        packs or swabs have been left behind in the abdomen.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Elective Caesarean Section, 'trial of scar',
        or Caesarean Section early in labour?</h2>
    <p>If a woman has had one Caesarean Section,
        the alternatives for the next pregnancy are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>an elective Caesarean Section, before labour ensues.</li>
        <li>a Caesarean Section in early labour. </li>
        <li>an attempt at vaginal delivery (a <q>trial of scar</q> (TOS),
            or <q>vaginal birth after Caesar</q> (VBAC)).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A lower segment Caesarean Section is sometimes done for
        such conditions as foetal distress, placenta praevia, or the
        prolapse of the cord or an arm, which are unlikely to happen
        again in a later pregnancy. When a woman like this becomes
        pregnant again, there is every reason to expect that the
        labour will be normal, except for the scar that she now has in
        the uterus. This will almost always give some warning
        before it ruptures, so, with good supervision, you can safely
        let her have further attempts at delivering vaginally.</p>
    <p>She can have as many trials (TOS or VBAC) as she likes,
        provided the previous one was successful,
        but she must have only had 1 previous Caesarean Section.
        Sometimes, however, after several TOS there is only a very
        thin membrane, the peritoneum, separating the uterine and
        the abdominal cavity. A subsequent TOS is more likely to
        end in disaster in this case.</p>
    <p>If a woman has had two or more Caesarean Sections, you should
        nearly always repeat the Caesarean Section.<br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>N.B. It is a good idea with any multipara to discuss during
        the antenatal period whether, if she needs a Caesarean
        Section in any case, she would also like a sterilisation.
        Note it on her medical card that it has been discussed and
        what the result of the discussion was.</i><br>
        This is even more important where women have one scar
        from a Caesarean Section.</p>
    <p><b>TWO CAESARS OR MORE;
        ALWAYS A CAESAR AGAIN</b></p>
    <p>When you try a trial of scar, admit the patient to hospital and
        monitor her closely. If the scar shows signs of rupturing,
        perform a Caesarean Section immediately. These warning
        signs only last 1-2hrs, before the uterus ruptures,
        <i>so you must monitor her with the greatest care.</i></p>
    <p><b>If CPD was the reason for the Caesarean Section,</b>
        it reduces the chances of a successful trial of scar in the
        current pregnancy, but <i>does not exclude it,</i> because:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>the pelvis continues to grow up to the age of 19yrs,</li>
        <li>uterine action is often poor in the under-16s.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>NO TRIAL OF SCAR
        IF THE PREVIOUS CAESAREAN SECTION
        WAS MIDLINE CLASSICAL!</p>
    <p>You can assume that no progress after 6cm cervical dilation
        in the 2nd stage of labour after a Caesarean Section,
        with a vertex presentation and good (oxytocin-induced)
        contractions means CPD. Caesarean Section for foetal
        distress in developing countries is most often related to
        CPD.</p>
    <p>ONE VERTICAL SCAR, ALWAYS ANOTHER</p>
    <p>Good care during a trial of scar means that monitoring must
        be reliable, and you must be able to perform a Caesarean
        Section within 1hr, even if it is 3am at night.</p>
    <p>If the organization and discipline of your hospital are not
        such that it can provide care of this quality, elective
        Caesarean Section will give the mother a better chance of
        saving her foetus, as well as her own uterus, and perhaps her
        life.</p>
    <p><i>If it takes several hours to find a driver, to fetch you, and to
        prepare the theatre, a trial of scar will be dangerous.
        Ideally, uterine rupture should never occur during a trial of
        scar.</i></p>
    <p>Even when conditions are not ideal, a trial of scar may be
        justified, because the immediate and future risks of a further
        Caesarean Section can be considerable. If a woman knows
        that she cannot have a trial of scar in hospital, she may try to
        have a dangerous trial by herself at home. A woman will
        usually understand if you say, <q>We will give you a try,
        and if you have any difficulty, we will perform another
        Caesarean Section”.</q><br>
        Ask the clinics to refer all women who have had a previous
        Caesarean Section, and who are sure of their dates, at
        34wks, so that you can assess. If a trial of scar is not
        indicated, plan an elective Caesarean Section at 38wks, or in
        early labour, if a woman is not sure of her dates.</p>
    <p>Elective Caesarean Sections are a way to avoid a trial of
        scar, but they are not the complete answer: you may perform
        a Caesarean Section too early because the dates may be
        uncertain, but even if they are certain, they need to be
        confirmed by early ultrasound, and risk prematurity.
        Furthermore, you may become unpopular, so find out what
        the local women think.</p>
    <p>The best indication that a uterine scar is going to rupture is a
        tachycardia, or foetal distress. Make observations 1/2hrly.
        If the foetal pulse rises >160/min, or drops persistently
        &#60;100/min, or there is pain between contractions, the scar is
        probably rupturing, so proceed to Caesarean Section.
        Other signs are described below.</p>
    <p><small><i>HARBANS KAUR (38yrs, gravida 4 para 3) was admitted at 9am on a
        Saturday, for a trial of scar, having had one previous Caesarean Section
        with the first pregnancy. She was 7cm dilated and had good contractions.
        At noon she was fully dilated and the foetal head was 3/5 above the brim.
        During the next half-hour it remained there. The doctor on duty was called
        for another emergency Caesarean Section, so the intern was advised to
        attempt vacuum extraction. He failed, but in doing so, he included the
        cervix under the cup, and tore it. At 3pm she developed pain, shock,
        and abdominal tenderness, and the foetal heartbeat disappeared.
        She was rushed to the theatre. The uterus had ruptured, and the tear had
        extended into the bladder. The superintendent was called. He found that the
        ureter had been caught in a hastily applied suture. The following day she
        was found to be leaking urine vaginally. LESSONS. These are many, they
        include: (1) In multiparas the second stage should not last longer than 20
        minutes. (2) A vacuum extractor was applied when the head was 3/5 above
        the brim. It should be only 1/5 above or less (except for a trial of vacuum or
        symphysiotomy). (3) When you apply the cup of a vacuum extractor,
        you should make sure that you do not include the cervix. (4) When a trial of
        scar is done, it must be possible to perform an immediate Caesarean Section
        if the trial fails.</i></small></p>
    <p>WARNING SIGNS MAY ONLY LAST 1-2HRS
        BEFORE RUPTURE</p>
    <p>TRIAL OF SCAR INDICATIONS.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A woman who has had only one previous lower segment
        Caesarean Section, and the indication for it is absent in the
        current pregnancy.</li>
        <li>A scar from a myomectomy (provided the uterine cavity
        was not opened during the operation), hysterotomy (21.5),
        or uterine perforation during a D&C.</li>
    </ol>
        <p> N.B. A request for tubal ligation may induce you to
        perform an elective Caesarean Section. On its own, it is not
        a reason to avoid vaginal delivery, because this followed by
        tubal ligation will still be safer for the patient whether she
        arrives in labour or not.</p>
    <p>CONDITIONS.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Only one or fewer prior Caesarean Section.</li>
        <li>In hospital. </li>
        <li>Caesarean Section must be available within 1hr any time
            of the day or night.</li>
        <li>Estimated foetal weight &#60;4kg.</li>
        <li>A vertex presentation in the occipito-anterior position.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>CONTRAINDICATIONS.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Two or more previous lower segment Caesarean Sections.</li>
        <li>1 previous classical midline Caesarean Section</li>
        <li>Any degree of CPD, or suspected CPD in this pregnancy.</li>
        <li>An occipito-posterior presentation.</li>
        <li>Any other form of malpresentation, (except perhaps a
        breech, if you are experienced) or obstetric complication.</li>
        <li>Foetal or maternal distress.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>METHOD. Assess all pregnant women with a uterine scar
        in the antenatal clinic at 36wks. Take a careful history.
        Assess the pelvis clinically and assess the size of the foetus
        by measuring the height of the fundus; if it is >40cm, do not
        do a trial of scar. A previous successful vaginal delivery at
        term is a good omen.</p>
    <p>Ask the patient to avoid heavy work during the last month of
        pregnancy, or to come in for rest. If possible, admit her to a
        waiting area at 36wks for rest and observation.
        When labour starts, restrict oral intake to fluids only.
        Do not as a rule induce labour. Unless your blood bank can
        be relied upon to have blood available within 1hr,
        have it cross-matched, and ready to use if necessary.
        Record the pulse and the foetal heart rate carefully.</p>
    <p>You may sometimes be able to feel the scar in the lower
        segment at vaginal examination. This will be easier if you
        are using epidural anaesthesia. If it bulges or feels weak,
        perform a Caesarean Section immediately: you may be able
        to assess weakness of the scar on ultrasound. The tenderness
        of a scar is difficult to assess in labour, and is not on its own,
        an indication for Caesarean Section. Assist delivery with
        vacuum extraction, if necessary.</p>
    <p><b>Abandon the trial</b> if:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The alert line is crossed on the partograph!</li>
        <li>The foetal pulse rises to 160.</li>
        <li>There is pain between contractions.</li>
        <li>Pain is generalized.</li>
        <li>There is unexplained vaginal bleeding or haematuria,
            <i>though this may be caused by the balloon of a Foley catheter
            being inflated in the urethra when the foetal head is low.</i></li>
        <li>Uterine contractions cease.</li>
        <li>There is rectal or vaginal tenesmus</li>
        <li>Restlessness ensues.</li>
        <li>Palpation of the uterine scar causes the patient to hit you
            on the hand!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Stay with the patient during labour so that you can examine
        the lower uterine segment vaginally immediately after
        delivery of the placenta, so as to be sure that it has not
        ruptured. This is uncomfortable, but does not need
        anaesthesia if you do it just after the placenta is delivered.
        <i>Do not delay because vaginal examination is an insufficient
        indication for a GA!</i> If you find a rupture, which may
        present as postpartum haemorrhage, <i>do not delay but
        proceed</i> to laparotomy (21.17).</p>
