<h1>Vesico-vaginal Fistula (VVF)</h1>
<p>Fistulae are usually the result of:<br>
    (1) obstructed labour in a young primigravida (21.4).<br>
    (2) unskilled Caesarean Section.<br>
    (3) rupture of the uterus into the bladder, especially through
    the scar of a previous Caesarean Section.<br>
    (4) traumatic vaginal delivery (especially with Kielland's
    forceps).</p>
<img src="./resources/images/VVFMechanism.png" class="VVFMechanism">
<p>Fistulae result as the unrelieved obstructed foetal head
    impacts against the back of the pubis, especially in very
    young girls (&#60;16yrs). The head cannot move further,
    resulting in pressure necrosis of the vaginal and adjacent
    bladder wall (A). If the pressure of the head is exerted
    posteriorly (B), the result may be a <a href="RVF.html">rectovaginal fistula.</a></p>
<p>A vesico-vaginal fistula (VVF) means uncontrollable
    urinary incontinence for the young woman, usually stillbirth,
    and often also infertility subsequently. After the catastrophe
    of losing her baby in childbirth, the young mother is often
    thrown out of the home because she cannot have sexual
    intercourse, is incontinent and smelly. She is rarely able to
    find a job, becomes depressed, lies curled up in the corner of
    a house where she can find lodging, develops contractures
    and pressure sores, and dies neglected.</p>
<p>There are estimated to be 3 million untreated VVF patients
    in Africa alone. In Ethiopia there are just under 10,000 new
    cases per year, and the Fistula Hospital in that country has
    gained a well-deserved world-wide reputation for the
    treatment of such fistulae. If you can get training there
    (or at another special centre) you will not regret it, but do
    not think that all VVF must be handled at a specialist centre:
    there are too many fistula victims for this to be feasible.
    They have a reputation of being impossibly difficult to
    repair, but this is not so for at least 25% of cases.
    Certainly, though, your best chance of success is in the first
    attempt; so, do not perform this operation unless you are
    reasonably experienced, or have gone to a special training
    centre, preferably several times in between increasing your
    own experience. The important thing is to be able to
    recognize which is the easier fistula, and which the
    complicated. You are advised to leave the latter, and the
    second or subsequent repairs, to experts.</p>
<p>Even then, experts who tackle every type of case will only
    achieve 75% success, meaning total continence (i.e. absence
    of stress incontinence, which is often severe). Anyone who
    claims a 100% success rate either has not done many,
    has selected easier cases, or has not done a proper follow-up.</p>
<p>N.B. A <i><a href="https://vimeo.com/123839410">gracilis</a></i> flap is easy to learn and can help out in
    many difficulties: try to get an expert to show you how to do
    this!</p>
<p>Fistula surgery for easier cases does not need special
    instruments or equipment; good post-operative nursing care
    is, however, very important but not complicated and you can
    achieve success even when you have not done such surgery
    previously.</p>
<p>These cases are immensely rewarding, because you can
    transform the life of a young woman from existence as an
    outcast; indeed one of the most senior VVF surgeons in
    Addis Abeba started off as an outcast VVF patient!</p>
<p>SITE OF THE FISTULA<br>
    The area where pressure necrosis occurs will be where the
    fistula results. Most commonly this is the urethro-vesical
    junction, but other sites can occur together or individually:
    juxta-urethral, mid-vaginal, juxta-cervical and intra-cervical.</p>
<img src="./resources/images/VVFSites.png" class="VVFSites">
<p>The first is the most common: if ischaemia is mild, a small
    hole is produced (21-20A), if ischaemia is prolonged,
    the defect may be circumferential and result in separation of
    the urethra, which becomes closed off, from the bladder
    itself (21-20B). The mid-vaginal fistulae are less common
    but easy to repair, unless they extend to the cervix (21-20C).
    The juxta-cervical fistula (21-20D) usually follows a vertical
    tear in the lower segment at Caesarean Section (21.10):
    the defect may include the anterior cervix, and encroach
    onto the ureteric orifice (21-20E). The intra-cervical fistula
    may be due to prolonged pushing against an incompletely
    dilated cervix, or due to iatrogenic injury at Caesarean
    Section (21-20F).</p>
<p>FEATURES OF THE FISTULA<br>
    Apart from their position, take note of their size:
    tiny (admitting only a probe) to large (>3cm, usually
    involving most of the anterior vaginal wall and the complete
    vesico-urethral junction). Occasionally the fistula may be
    truly extensive extending to the anterior bladder wall,
    and exposing the bare bone of the back of the pubis.
    The ureters may even be draining freely outside the bladder!</p>
<p>Take note of the amount of <b>scar tissue</b>: if you find extensive
    scarring, leave the case to an experienced surgeon.
    Note the remaining <b>length of the urethra</b>: the shorter it is
    and the more scar tissue that needs to be removed, the bigger
    the risk of stress incontinence.</p>
<p>PROPHYLAXIS<br>
    <b>At Caesarean Section</b>, take care to dissect the bladder well
    down off the lower segment prior to incising the uterus.
    If the head is deeply impacted in the pelvis, get an assistant
    to push from below, rather than inserting your hand between
    the foetal head and the lower segment.</p>
<p><b>After Caesarean Section</b>, take care when suturing lower
    segment tears, and always ask yourself if you have not
    inadvertently picked up the bladder.
    Leave a urinary catheter in situ at least 10days after a
    Caesarean Section performed for prolonged obstructed
    labour.</p>
<p><b>At follow-up</b>, if urine is leaking, leave a Ch18 urinary
    catheter in situ for 4-6wks, making sure you inflate the
    balloon only with a maximum of 10ml, and the balloon is
    not inflated in the urethra. Let the urine drain freely.
    Recommend sitz baths to wash the perineum, a high protein
    diet with haematinics, copious drinking of fluids to 5l/day,
    good mobilization, and abstinence from sexual intercourse
    for 3months.</p>
<p>HISTORY<br>
    <b>Age and parity</b>: (some patients still achieve pregnancy after
    developing a fistula after a Caesarean Section).</p>
<p><b>Incontinence.</b> Check if the patient is wet all the time:
    if she is dry at night, a fistula is unlikely. Ask about faecal as
    well as urinary incontinence. They may be separate or
    combined.</p>
<p><b>Amenorrhoea</b>. Ask about menstruation: it often stops after
    traumatic childbirth, but may suggest a hysterectomy about
    which the patient was never informed.</p>
<p><b>Delivery</b>. Ask if labour was prolonged, delivery difficult
    and traumatic. Ask if it was at home, in a clinic or at
    hospital. Note whether a Caesarean Section was performed,
    and if so, how many times.</p>
<p><b>Previous Surgery</b>. Ask sympathetically if previous attempts
    at repair have been made: remember patients may try to hide
    this fearing they may be turned away.</p>
<p><b>Neurological deficit</b>. Look especially for a foot drop, even
    if partially recovered.</p>
<p>EXAMINATION<br>
    <b>General</b>. Note malnutrition, state of hydration
    (many patients drink little in order to reduce their wetness),
    anaemia and the psychological state.</p>
<p><b>Dermatitis & pressure sores.</b> Look for an obvious urinary
    leak and signs of dermatitis (discoloured darkened or
    reddened skin around the perineum) and examine pressure
    points. If you cannot see any wetness, ask the patient to
    drink plenty of water and re-examine her after 1hr. Get the
    patient to cough if you still cannot visualise any wetness.</p>
<p><b>Urethral orifice.</b> Is it destroyed or stenosed?</p>
<p><b>Vagina.</b> Perform a gentle digital examination and then if
    necessary, with a Simsâ€™ speculum. You may find it easier in
    theatre in the lithotomy position with a good light,
    but you do not need a GA. Is the vagina stenosed?
    The lateral or posterior surfaces may feel fibrous, or the
    whole vagina narrowed. Is there a palpable defect
    anteriorly? If so, where is it in relation to the urethra and
    cervix? Are the margins of the fistula soft and supple,
    or firm, or even fixed to the pubic bone? Can you identify
    the cervix? Does it feel normal? Is the vagina shortened?<br><br>
<b>Ureter.</b> If you suspect ureteric damage after Caesarean
    Section, ask the patient to empty her bladder and then insert
    a dry swab high in the vagina. Get her to drink water,
    walk about and then 30mins later, remove the swab, looking
    for wetness.<br><br>
    <b>Ano-rectum.</b> Examine for anal sphincter function:
    this is often impaired after delivery. Look for evidence of
    urine flowing out of the anus.</p>
<p>DYE TEST<br>
    Use <i>dilute</i> methylene blue or gentian violet:
    too concentrated dye will colour everything making
    interpretation impossible. Introduce a urinary catheter and
    inflate the balloon. Place 3 moist swabs well up in the
    vagina; then insert 50ml slowly into the catheter.
    Remove the swabs gently one by one. A fistula is confirmed
    if the 2
    nd or 3
    rd but not the 1
    st swab is discoloured with dye.<br><br>
<b>If you do not see any swab stained blue,</b> repeat the test
    with 200ml after leaving the dye 20mins in the bladder. If this 2
    nd test is -ve, suspect a uretero-vaginal fistula
    (see above). If the 3rd gauze is wet but not blue, suspect a
    ureteric fistula (21.11).<br><br>
</b>If after you have removed the catheter, leaving the dye
    inside, the colour dribbles out</b>, especially on coughing,
    this indicates stress incontinence which you should treat
    with pelvic floor exercises, or 12wks of continuous catheter
    draining if there is an atonic bladder with overflow after
    delivery.</p>
<p>SELECTION OF CASES<br>
    Select a straightforward case for your first attempts at repair;
    you will get a good reputation through success,
    so <i>do not attempt any difficult cases until you have
    considerable experience.</i> You will do your patients and your
    reputation no good by attempting difficult cases and failing.
    <i>Do not waste time with futile investigations and treatment</i>:
    if you cannot treat a patient, refer her early.</p>
<p>CONTRA-INDICATIONS<br>
    Do not attempt:<br>
    (1) Complex fistulae, including those you have difficulty
    visualising, and rectovaginal fistulae, except in special
    circumstances (21.19).<br>
    (2) Where the urethra is completely detached.<br>
    (3) Cases where there is considerable scarring<br>
    (4) Surgery in grossly malnourished, anaemic or untreated
    HIV+ve patients.<br>
    (5) A case where you are uncertain how to proceed.</p>
<p>PREPARATION<br>
    Explain clearly what the patient is to expect, especially the
    length of time she will be in hospital and how long she may
    need a urinary catheter, and how long she may need to
    abstain from sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>Make sure the patient is well hydrated from the moment you
    take the decision to operate. She should be drinking
    6-8l/day before operation. Make sure she gets a high protein
    diet, iron and folate. Stop fluids only 4hrs before
    anaesthesia. <i>You should see urine dripping when she stands
    with legs apart.<br>
    There is no indication for pre-operative antibiotics.</i>
    Make sure the rectum is empty by getting the patient to go to
    the toilet just before theatre, or administering an enema the
    evening before.<br>
     <i>N.B. It is no good doing this just before theatre because
    the perineum will be contaminated.</i></p>
<p>EQUIPMENT<br>
    No special equipment is necessary: you will need a self-retaining weighted
    Auvard speculum, good-quality dissecting scissors, toothed dissecting
    forceps, Allis tissue forceps, artery forceps, a metal catheter, a small probe,
    towel clips and a #15 blade.<br>
    Sharply curved Thorek scissors, sharp Deschamps aneurysm needle and
    long vaginal instruments are a great help.<br>
    Long-acting absorbable sutures are ideal: do not use non-absorbable.
    Half-circle 25mm round-bodied needles are best, though J-shaped needles
    are very useful in more difficult cases.<br>
    You will need an operating table which tilts and has shoulder rests for more
    complex cases. A headlight is very useful; if this is missing, turn the table
    to face the bright sunshine!</p>
<p>METHOD OF VVF REPAIR (GRADE 3.3)<br>
    Place the patient, with the buttocks well over the end of the
    table, in the exaggerated lithotomy position with legs flexed
    and slightly abducted. Make sure your position is
    comfortable, that your seat is not too high or the operating
    table too low.</p>
<p>Suture the labia to the thighs, and cover the anus with a
    swab (21-21A), or insert a temporary purse-string suture to
    close it if faecal leakage is troublesome.</p>
<p>Record the size and position of the fistula.
    Estimate the distance from the external urethral orifice to the
    distal fistula margin (ideally 3-4cm), and that from the
    proximal fistula margin to the cervix (ideally >4cm)
    (21-21B). The nearer the fistula is to the cervix, the greater
    is the danger to the ureters.</p>
<p>Only operate juxta-cervical fistulae in multiparous women
    with where you can easily pull the cervix downwards.</p>
<p>Pass artery forceps or a metal catheter through the urethra,
    holding it to point forwards to expose the fistula clearly
    (21-21C). Check if the urethra is detached from the bladder:
    in this case, leave it for an expert.</p>
<p>Administer gentamicin 160mg IV plus metronidazole
    500mg if there has been faecal contamination.</p>
<p>Check with ultrasound if there are stones within the bladder,
    and estimate its size.</p>
<img src="./resources/images/VVFRepair.png" class="VVFRepair">
<p>Infiltrate the tissues between the vagina and bladder with
    dilute (1:200,000) adrenaline solution (21-21D).</p>
<p>Whilst steadying the anterior vaginal wall with the forceps
    passed through the urethral orifice, lift up the mucosa over
    the urethra with an Allis forceps and incise in the posterior
    margin of the fistula through the vagina (21-21E).</p>
<p>Identify the correct plane between vagina and bladder and
    continue to dissect round to the sides so that you
    mobilize at least 1cm beyond the fistula hole (21-21F).
    Start the anterior dissection with a little extension vertically
    towards the urethra and complete it right round; then tie the
    right and left antero-lateral flaps to the labia to
    improve the exposure of the fistula. Do not use diathermy.
    Trim away with scissors any vaginal mucosa and scar tissue
    (this should be minimal) at the fistula margin (21-21G).
    Now you have freshened up and exposed the margins of the
    fistula, you can start closure from the corners (21-21H).
    Insert 2 sutures and complete the repair with interrupted
    big bites taking in the full thickness of the
    bladder muscle, but not the bladder mucosa (21-21I,J).
    Remove the forceps in the urethra and insert a catheter,
    and perform a dye test (21-21K) with 50ml of dilute
    solution. Press over the abdomen or ask the patient to cough
    to see if there is any discolouration. If there is a leak through
    the suture line, inset another one or two sutures, and re-test.
    Exclude the presence of a second, unsuspected, fistula
    higher up.</p>
<p>Finally, close the vagina with interrupted everting mattress
    sutures, and fix the catheter in situ with a suture to the
    labium. Place a betadinized pack gently in the vagina.</p>
<p>DIFFICULTIES WITH SIMPLE VVF REPAIR</p>
<p><b>If exposure is poor,</b> perform an episiotomy, on both sides,
    if necessary (and remember to repair them at the end of the
    operation).<br><br>
<b>If there is necrotic sloughy tissue,</b> debride this adequately
    and review the situation when all the tissues are clean and
    fresh. This is likely, however, to become a complex fistula,
    however.<br><br>
<b>If the urethra is stenosed,</b> try to dilate it with sounds.
    Remember you will need more generous exposure of the
    fistula, and need to excise scar tissue. You may find the
    stenosis recurs and needs regular dilation, so keep a careful
    follow-up.<br><br>
<b>If you find bladder stones,</b> unless the stone is small,
    or comes out easily through the fistula, abandon the VVF
    repair, and proceed to cystolithotomy (27.16). Schedule the
    VVF repair at least 2wks later.<br><br>
<b>If you suspect the ureter to be damaged,</b> you are likely to
    be dealing with a juxta-cervical fistula, which is a matter for
    an expert.</p>
<p><b>If your operation is taking >1hr,</b> you are either tackling
    too complex a fistula, or there is some difficulty with your
    technique. Consult this manual and get help.</p>
<p>POST-OPERATIVE CARE<br>
    You may have performed marvellous surgery, only for it to
    be ruined by poor nursing care; so make sure before you
    embark on VVF repairs that you involve all your nursing
    staff and explain what is needed and why. Keep a simple
    record of patients on their beds: measuring urine output is
    unnecessary</p>
<p><b>(1) The aim is that the patient is drinking freely, draining
    urine freely and free to mobilize without being wet.</b>
    <i>The catheter must never block:</i> if this happens, urine will
    emerge alongside the tube or even leak through your
    well-sutured repair and re-create the fistula. The problem
    about drainage bags is that they can fill up (quickly if the
    patient is drinking well) and fall on the floor, or cause
    traction on the catheter when the patient turns in bed,
    or overfill and cause back-pressure, or twist and become
    blocked.<br>
    The easiest solution is connecting the catheter to a straight
    plastic tube that drains freely into a basin or bucket: this has
    the advantage that you can readily see if urine is dripping
    freely from the tube.</p>
<p><b>If the catheter blocks,</b><i> i.e. you no longer see urine dripping
    from the tube, and the patient is wet or has a full bladder,</i>
    act immediately: untwist the catheter, unkink the tubing
    (or replace it, if it is full of dÃ©bris), gently irrigate the
    catheter with a bladder syringe. If this does not make urine
    flow, replace the catheter.<br>
    <i>Urine will not flow if the patient is not drinking!</i>
    So make sure she drinks 5l/day, because concentrated
    urine flows poorly and is susceptible to become infected.
    The urine should be almost colourless. </p>
<p><b>If the patient is wet,</b> exclude a blocked catheter. Check if
    urine is leaking alongside the tube during bladder irrigation:
    this may suggest urethral dysfunction. Perform a dye test to
    check your repair or look for a second (missed) fistula.</p>
<p>(2) <b>Wash the perineum twice daily,</b> especially where the
    catheter emerges from the urethra.<br><br>
    (3) <b>Remove the vaginal pack</b> after 48hrs.<br><br>
    (4) <b>Mobilize the patient,</b> carrying a bucket to drain her
    urine.<br><br>
    (5) <b>Remove the catheter</b> after 12-14days after you have
    confirmed that a dye test shows no leak. Encourage the
    patient to pass urine every 2hrs and then increase the
    interval gradually as bladder tone recovers. <i>Do not clamp
    and unclamp the catheter</i>: this all too frequently leads to
    disaster!</p>
<p>(6) <b>Before discharge:</b> wait 48hrs after removing the
    catheter. Check if the patient is dry; if not, perform a dye
    test. If it is
    +ve, all is not lost, though an early leak suggests
    a worse prognosis. Keep the catheter in situ a further 4wks if
    more urine drains through the catheter than the vagina.
    Monitor to see if the leak is reducing. Lying in the prone
    position allows the catheter tip to rest free from the fistula.<br><br> 
    (7) <b>General advice.</b> Insist on abstinence from sexual
    intercourse for 3months. Advise on tubal ligation or
    contraceptives. Further delivery must be by Caesarean
    Section. Recommend a high fluid intake to prevent infection
    and development of urinary stones. Persuade patients to
    come for regular follow up so you can check whether a late
    leak or urethral stenosis develops, or stress incontinence
    persists, and you can do an audit of your activity. In these
    latter cases, try to to get help from an expert.</p>
