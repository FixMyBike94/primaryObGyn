    <h1>Breech Presentation</h1>
    <p><b>If a foetus presents with his buttocks (breech) or his foot,</b> he is about four times more likely to die than if he presents by his vertex. This is so, even if you exclude the excess mortality due to the higher rate of prematurity, multiple pregnancy and foetal abnormality that is associated with breech deliveries.</p>
    <p>This increased mortality is due to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Late diagnosis, in the case of cephalopelvic disproportion, unless you can perform a swift, skilled symphysiotomy (21.7).</li>
        <li>Lack of time for the head to mould so that there is effectively CPD though this would not have been the case in a cephalic presentation.</li>
        <li>An incompletely dilated cervix (especially with straining before full dilatation, or prematurity).</li>
        <li>The increased risk of cord prolapse.</li>
        <li>Nobody being present able to solve the problem of the arms being extended.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These are methods which may help prevent breech delivery if you find a breech presentation after 36wks:</p>
    <p>THE KNEE-CHEST POSITION (as if praying like a Muslim, 22-2C) is an alternative to manipulation that might succeed. It is also safer. Ask the mother to spend 10min tds in this position. This may allow the foetal breech to disimpact from the pelvis, so that it can turn spontaneously.</p>
    <p>EXTERNAL CEPHALIC VERSION (ECV)</p>
    <p>If you can reduce the number of breeches you deliver, you will reduce the perinatal mortality associated with them. Turning a breech presentation in the 3rd trimester will do this, but it is of little value &#60;34wks in a primipara, or &#60;36wks in a multipara, because many breech presentations spontaneously correct themselves before this.</p>
    <p>After 36wks, a foetus gradually becomes less mobile, which makes version more difficult. On the other hand, if version does succeed, it is more likely to be permanent.</p>
    <p>The risks of ECV include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Knotting of the cord.</li>
        <li>Placental abruption.</li>
        <li>Uterine rupture.</li>
        <li>Vertical transmission of HIV.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These risks must be compared not only with the risks of breech delivery but also of Caesarean Section.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, ECV is not often done by doctors or by experienced midwives as often as it should be; <i>it should not be done by inexperienced practitioners.</i> If your excess perinatal mortality with breech deliveries is >2%, after correcting for prematurity and foetal abnormality (see below), the risks of ECV are worth taking. <i>Do not attempt it under GA!</i></p>
    <p>THE CORRECTED PERINATAL MORTALITY FOR BREECH DELIVERIES.</p>
    <p>This should be fairly easy to calculate from your labour ward record books, which should routinely record presentation, birth weight, obvious abnormalities, and live and still births.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Work out your perinatal mortality for all babies (10-80/1000) excluding breeches, babies <25kg, twins, and babies with obvious malformations. The perinatal period lasts (in this case) from the 28th week to the end of the 1st week of life.</li>
        <li>Do the same for breech deliveries only. In many district hospitals, it will be 50-200/1000.
            Subtract (1) from (2). If the difference is >20/1000, perform ECV.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The problem is of course that the higher the breech related mortality is, the higher the Caesarean Section related mortality is likely to be. The reasons for high breech related mortality usually include absence of permanently available skilled personnel and/or patients arriving too late. These are exactly the same factors which make it very dangerous for women to have a scar on the uterus.</p>
    <p><b>If ECV or the knee-chest position fail,</b> you can deliver a breech:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Vaginally, by assisted breech delivery.</li>
        <li>Vaginally, by breech extraction.</li>
        <li>Vaginally, adding a symphysiotomy if there is CPD.</li>
        <li>Abdominally, by Caesarean Section.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In breech extraction you, rather than the mother, provide the power for expulsion. You exert traction on the legs, groins and pelvis, so it is more dangerous for the foetus than an assisted breech delivery, which is the usual way of delivering a breech. Only do this extraction if there is no alternative (foetal distress) or with the 2nd of twins.</p>
    <p>Otherwise IV oxytocin will probably help especially if the foetus is smaller than average. If the foetus is large or normal in size lack of progress of the buttocks in the second stage might predict subsequent CPD (see below).</p>
    <p>Perhaps an acceptable approach in nullipara would be to prepare for a Caesarean Section at 36-37wks. Administer spinal anaesthesia. Try to turn the foetus. There is then a success rate of 2/3 as opposed to 1/3 without spinal anaesthesia.</p>
    <p>If you succeed, cancel surgery. This is without danger in a nullipara, but at higher parity where there is a risk of rupture, the mother will not be able to warn you by indicating pain. However, a mother who has previously delivered spontaneously vaginally around term has certainly no indication for an elective Caesarean Section for a simple breech presentation.</p>
    <p>Judgement is difficult nonetheless, if for example a primipara delivered by vacuum extraction the last time. There could have been borderline CPD, or was it just a tired mother or an impatient doctor, occiput posterior position, or foetal distress? Probably the best would be to try ECV but without spinal anaesthesia.</p>
    <p><i>N.B. Performing an elective Caesarean Section for breech presentation without very good reasons is irresponsible, if you cannot guarantee good supervision for trial of scar and access to a Caesarean Section for the next delivery.</i></p>
    <p>A liberal Caesarean Section rate will reduce your perinatal mortality, but you will have to weigh this against the increased maternal morbidity and mortality that will follow. If the difficulties of vaginal breech delivery worry you, and you are tempted to perform a Caesarean Section for all breech presentations, remember the dangers of anaesthesia, bleeding, sepsis, and a scarred uterus. However, if your hospital has not the skill available continuously to perform a vaginal breech delivery and there is no guarantee of a swift referral to a place with these skills, then you might be forced to perform an elective Caesarean Section on a breech presentation at 37wks.</p>
    <p><b>If there is any question of CPD</b> before or during the 2nd stage of labour, have everything ready (including infiltrating the symphysis with LA) for a possible symphysiotomy (21.7), or proceed to Caesarean Section.</p>
    <p>In communities where the contracted pelvis is common, the risks of a breech delivery are great, so that to be sure all these babies survive, you may have to perform a Caesarean Section on all mothers without a proven adequately sized pelvis; and this you can only know if they have delivered vaginally at term successfully beforehand.</p>
    <p><i>N.B. Do not allow a mother with a true conjugate (21.4) of &#60;9cm to deliver a full term breech vaginally unless you can perform a symphysiotomy!</i></p>
    <p>A foetus with IUGR or prematurity presenting by as a breech is a problem. Much depends on the foetal age:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>&#60;28wks gestation (&#60;1kg): the chances of life are small, the lower segment is poorly formed, and it is questionable if Caesarean Section will be any less traumatic than vaginal delivery.</li>
        <li>From 28-32wks (1-1·5kg) the foetus may have a better chance with Caesarean Section, especially if it is a footling presentation. However, about 20% have severe abnormalities, and if you do not have ventilators, even the normal ones have a poor chance of surviving. So, in an area of high parity and high perinatal mortality, you should rarely perform a Caesarean Section for a premature breech presentation. It is important to dissuade the mother from pushing before full dilatation: <i>do not leave her alone!</i></li>
    </ol>
    <img src="" class="">
    <p><b>Symphysiotomy</b> (21.7) is useful in breech delivery for the unbooked patient, who is admitted in the 2nd stage of labour, and when there is no time for a Caesarean Section. However, it is not a good idea to make your 1st unsupervised symphysiotomy in these circumstances, because if the head is stuck and you have tried everything else, there is then very little time left to deliver an undamaged foetus.</p>
    <p><b>If a breech delivery might end in a symphysiotomy</b> (21.7), it is good practice to infiltrate the symphysis and the skin over it already before it is needed, so as to shorten the time required for the probably necessary subsequent procedure. Have a catheter and a large size scalpel ready!</p>
    <p><b>Epidural anaesthesia</b> will prevent a mother bearing down before she is fully dilated, and it will make any manipulations that you have to do in the second stage of a vaginal delivery much easier. An occasional 'stuck breech', and a dead foetus, are more acceptable than a maternal death in most cultures. As your skill and experience and that of your staff improve, so will your successful vaginal deliveries.</p>
    <p>EXTERNAL CEPHALIC VERSION is possible at any time >34wks, until labour starts. It is not necessary &#60;34wks. You may not succeed >36wks, but it is still worth trying.</p>
    <p>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Multipara >3.</li>
        <li>Antepartum bleeding in this pregnancy.</li>
        <li>A previous Caesarean Section.</li>
        <li>The need to perform a Caesarean Section in this pregnancy for some other reason.</li>
        <li>A detected foetal abnormality.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>RELATIVE CONTRAINDICATIONS</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rh D-ve mother and no anti-D to treat her with. A successful ECV would often prevent more problems than it causes in Rhesus-ve women even when there is no anti-D available. Mortality related to rhesus antibodies seems to be rare in Africa even if allowances are made for the lower prevalence (+/- 4%) of Rh D-ve people.</li>
        <li>HIV+ve mother: mixing of blood during ECV might cause vertical transmission.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>N.B. If she uses antiviral medication, the risk is probably very small. If she is not using these drugs and she is planning to breast feed then perhaps you should proceed with an ECV because the foetus might become infected anyway and a Caesarean Section in an untreated HIV+ve patient has greater risks for the mother (not the foetus).</p>
    <p>If, on the other hand, she wants a sterilisation and/or can give safe alternatives to prolonged breastfeeding then a Caesarean Section will be better.</p>
    <p>METHOD (GRADE 1.3)</p>
    <p>Explain carefully what you are going to do. Empty the bladder and lie the patient supine tilted a little to one side. Flex the knees somewhat. Make sure your hands are warm and she is comfortable. You may find it helpful to lubricate your hands and the abdomen with glove powder. Find out which side the foetal back is situated. Count the heart rate. Place one hand below the breech, and your other hand above the head. Flex the foetus between your hands, so that you make him do a forward somersault (turn head over heels). Listen to his heart.</p>
    <p><b>If the heart rate slowed to &#60;100,</b> turn the patient on her side and wait until it is >100. If the heart rate has not started to recover within 2mins, turn him into his original position. His umbilical cord may be tight round his neck.</p>
    <p><b>If a forward somersault fails,</b> try turning him in a backward somersault.</p>
    <p><b>If both fail,</b> rest mother with the foot of the bed raised. If she is anxious use diazepam 5mg orally. Try again in an hour. If you fail again, try again at the next visit.</p>
    <p><b>If you succeed,</b> see her again 1wk later to make sure the presentation is still cephalic.</p>
    <p><b>If you cannot turn her foetus by 37wks,</b> manage her as a breech delivery.</p>
    <p>INDICATIONS FOR CAESAREAN SECTION</p>
    <p>N.B. If the patient has a normal or large pelvis, and the foetus is normal-sized, she will probably deliver vaginally. At vaginal examination, if you cannot touch the sacral promontory easily with your middle finger, which means the diagonal conjugate is >11cm (for a size 7 glove hand), the pelvis is probably large enough. The true conjugate, the narrowest diameter the foetal head must pass, is usually 1.5-2cm smaller.</p>
    <p><i>N.B. The best assurance of an adequate pelvis is of course a previous uncomplicated vaginal delivery at term, especially if that was a boy, who has on average a somewhat larger head than a girl.</i></p>
    <p>(A) ANTENATALLY:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Suspected CPD.</li>
        <li>A large foetus; if he feels as if he is big, that is >3.7kg (fundal height >40cm), regardless of the size of the pelvis.</li>
        <li>A previous Caesarean Section.</li>
        <li>Other obstetric hazards, such as placenta praevia, diabetes, gestational hypertension, or APH.</li>
        <li>An elderly primigravida, or if there is a long history of infertility.</li>
        <li>A previous stillbirth, especially if it was associated with a breech or instrumental delivery.</li>
        <li>Postmaturity >42wks.</li>
        <li>Previous operative vaginal deliveries unless certainly unrelated to (borderline) CPD.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>(B) DURING LABOUR:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A prolonged first stage with good contractions or failure to dilate fully. <i>The best approach is to use the partogram and the routine active management of labour: look for failure to progress which is not quickly amendable to the use of oxytocin.</i></li>
        <li>Arrest at the brim, or delay in the descent of the breech during the 2nd stage.</li>
        <li>A footling presentation (usually with one hip and knee extended): here, a woman can develop an irresistible desire to push before full dilatation, as the foetal feet enter the vagina. This can result in the head being caught behind the undilated cervix. On the other hand if she can restrain herself till that moment, a multipara with full dilatation can often deliver a foetus in one or two contractions.</li>
        <li>Cord presentation or prolapse: this is especially a problem in a frank breech (the feet touching the ears). In a footling breech, the cord is less likely to be compressed even if prolapsed.</li>
        <li>Foetal distress before full cervical dilatation.</li>
        <li>Prolonged rupture of the membranes with infection, but when labour is not advanced.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>N.B. If the membranes have ruptured but there most probably is no CPD, then starting labour with oxytocin and stopping the IV infusion when labour is established, is quite acceptable.</p>
    <p>Most additional factors, which compromise the wellbeing of a foetus, are indications for a Caesarean Section. Only for a healthy normal-sized mother with a foetus &#60;3.7kg (as indicated by a fundal height of <40cm), who progresses normally in both stages of labour, should you allow a vaginal delivery.</p>
    <p>ASSISTED BREECH DELIVERY (GRADE 1.5)</p>
    <p>CAUTION! For breech delivery you need a quiet atmosphere and good communication with the patient. <i>A crowd of supporters crying, “Push”, is not what you want.</i> Keep calm and explain what is happening.
        You will need an assistant.</p>
    <p>THE 1ST STAGE. If the cervix dilates at &#60;1cm/hr in the active phase, or there are any other signs of delay not quickly remediable by oxytocin, perform a Caesarean Section. Until the foetal buttocks are delivered, you can still elect to perform a Caesarean Section. If there is any delay before the delivery of the buttocks, go ahead with the Caesarean Section. Sometimes the feet appear so large that they frighten you into operating!</p>
    <p>THE 2ND STAGE. A common fault is to try to deliver a breech through an incompletely dilated cervix, which may force the arms to extend and make the head difficult to deliver. Full dilation may not be easy to diagnose in a breech, so take your time for a proper vaginal examination. Put the mother into the lithotomy position (essential if you effect the Burns-Marshall manoeuvre) when the posterior buttock is distending the perineum. As soon as she wants to bear down, do a vaginal examination to make sure that the cervix is fully dilated. The breech should advance with every contraction. Infiltrate the perineum with LA, and make an episiotomy in a nullipara, when the buttocks are distending it, and you can see a boy's scrotum (or a girl's labia). Protect the scrotum (you do not want the episiotomy to castrate him!). The buttocks and legs will then deliver.</p>
    <p><i>N.B. If the mother could have an HIV infection, it is best not to make an episiotomy or do it as belatedly as possible because the mother’s blood will come in contact with the foetal genitals and face and increase the risk of transmission.</i></p>
    <p>When the umbilicus delivers there is often a temporary halt in descent. Look at the clock. The foetus should be delivered in the next 3mins.</p>
    <p>Wait for progress to resume with the next contraction. The shoulders and arms should deliver with a twisting movement, and the head should follow immediately. <i>Do not touch the baby, or try to disentangle the legs,</i> until you see the umbilicus. Put your hand on the mother&#39;s fundus, observe each contraction, and keep a steady gentle pressure on the foetal head. When the umbilicus appears, disengage the extended legs.</p>
    <p>CAUTION! Try to make sure that the foetal back is uppermost. <i>Never allow the foetal abdomen to face upwards.</i></p>
    <p>When the scapulae appear (and not before), search for the arms in front of the chest. If, as is usual, the arms are not extended, they will both be in front of the chest. You should be able to deliver one or both of them. If you have difficulty, feel up to the shoulder from the foetal back and from there push down the arm, first one then the other. Allow the body to hang (22-3A). Its own weight will make the head descend through the birth canal. It will have been entering the pelvis, and may now be compressing the cord. Assist its descent with gentle suprapubic pressure. The foetus must be able to breathe in the next 1-2mins.</p>
    <img src="" class="">
    <p><b>If the head does not immediately deliver spontaneously when the arms are out,</b> try the BURNS-MARSHALL MANOEUVRE (22-4: GRADE 2.1). Wait until you can see the hairs on the back of the neck (22-3A,B), pull the foetus outwards a little and draw him outwards over the pubis. Put the back of the baby on his mother’s abdomen. Guard the perineum with your left hand (or get an assistant to do so) and prevent the head from emerging too quickly. As soon as the mouth and nose appear, pause, and ask your assistant to clear the airways and allow the baby to breathe (22-3C). Then, carefully deliver the rest of the head (22-3D).</p>
    <p><b>If you cannot get at least the mouth and nose into fresh air with the Burns-Marshall method, use:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>the MAURICEAU-SMELLIE-VEIT MANOEUVRE, or</li>
        <li>apply Wrigley (outlet) forceps to the aftercoming head.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Rest the foetal belly and chest on your right forearm; put your gloved right middle finger in the mouth, and your index and ring fingers on the cheek bones. Put your left hand over the back; put your middle finger on the occiput and your index and ring fingers over the shoulders. This will give you some control over the flexion and rotation of the head. Grip the skull and guide it through the birth canal. Ask the mother to stop pushing. Ask your assistant to put his fist on the foetal head, which is still palpable above the pubis, and to press obliquely downwards in the direction of the coccyx. You will feel a 'plop' indicating that the head has gone into the pelvis, and further delivery should then be easy.</p>
    <p>CAUTION! This is a method for getting a grip directly on the head. <i>NEVER pull on the shoulders:</i> you can too easily distract the cervical vertebrae and damage the cord.</p>
    <img src="" class="">
    <p>Fig. 22-4 TWO METHODS FOR DELIVERING THE HEAD IN A BREECH PRESENTATION.<br>
        A, applying forceps to the aftercoming head.<br> B, using the Mauriceau- Smellie-Veit manoeuvre: Rest the baby&#39;s belly and chest on your right forearm; put your right middle finger in the mouth, and your index and ring fingers on the cheek bones. Put your left hand over the back; put your middle finger on the occiput and your index and ring fingers over the shoulders. This will give you some control over the flexion and rotation of the head. Guide the head through the mother's birth canal but do not pull on the shoulders. The finger in the mouth is for convenience & orientation only. Do not apply traction on the jaw!</p>
    <img src="" class="">
    <p>EARLY DIFFICULTIES DELIVERING A BREECH<br> CAUTION!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Perform an episiotomy (except in a multipara with a lax outlet) before you do any manipulations, because there is a high risk of a perineal laceration, but lacerations tend to bleed less than early episiotomies, so consider the risk of HIV transmission.</li>
        <li><i>Do not squeeze the abdomen!</i></li>
        <li>If the head fails to descend, <i>do not pull on the neck.</i></li>
        <li>If the head becomes impacted and the foetus dies, <i>do not sever the neck, nor be tempted to open the uterus from above.</i></li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>If the breech is delayed at the brim, or in mid-cavity,</b> this is probably a warning sign of CPD; perform a Caesarean Section. <i>Do not try to effect a delivery using oxytocin unless you are prepared to make a symphysiotomy.</i></p>
    <p><b>If the breech is delayed at the outlet,</b> make sure that the episiotomy is adequate. There may be CPD. If the pelvis feels contracted, or the foetus (or the feet) are large, perform a Caesarean Section. If all is otherwise well, continue gentle groin traction, as for breech extraction.</p>
    <p><b>If you have delivered the legs but both shoulders have now stuck above the pelvic brim,</b> the arms are probably extended (22-5A). Normally you can put a finger up the posterior vaginal wall and easily bring them down. If you cannot, they are probably forced into extension. Try LØVSET'S MANOEUVRE (GRADE 2.2). It is a breech extraction for obstruction late in delivery, and should rarely be necessary. The delivery of the shoulders is prevented by two obstructions at different levels: the sacral promontory and the pubis. The principle of this method is that, by pulling the foetus tightly down, and by turning the body 180o, the shoulder which was held up above the pubis will turn to pass into the hollow of the sacrum.</p>
    <p>The shoulder which was above the sacrum will now be above the pubis. A hand in the posterior vaginal space may ease the arm down. Two further 'unscrewing' half-turns like this, each bringing the shoulders progressively below these obstructions will deliver the foetus.</p>
    <p>Grasp the thighs and pelvis with both hands (if the baby is slippery use a gauze swab or small towel), your thumbs along the foetal sacrum, your forefingers on the foetal symphysis, and your remaining fingers round the foetal thighs.</p>
    <p><b>If, in the extreme case, the foetus obstructs transversely</b>
        (22-5A), start by turning the body through 90o, so that the back faces to the left. The left shoulder will then be above the symphysis, and the right shoulder above the sacrum (22-5B). With your first 180o turn (22-5C), bring the left shoulder under the sacrum. With your second turn (22-5D) bring the right shoulder under the sacrum. The left arm will now be low enough for you to sweep it gently down. With your third turn (22-5DE) bring the right shoulder under the pubis; it will now be low enough for you to bring the right arm down.</p>
    <p>CAUTION!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>These three 180o turns are in opposite directions, so that the back always passes under the clitoris, and the arm which started posterior always drags across the face. The belly should never pass under the clitoris.</li>
        <li>In the worst case you start in 22-5A with both arms extended, so you have to begin with a 90o turn, followed by three 180o turns. If the foetus arrests at a later stage, with only one arm extended, you may only need 2 turns, or perhaps only one.</li>
        <li>The first 2 turns release the shoulder which was arrested above the symphysis when you started it. The 3rd turn enables you to bring down the right arm.</li>
        <li><i>Do not squeeze the belly, or back:</i> you may rupture the liver, kidneys, spleen, or adrenals (huge in the newborn). If you hold the chest, take care not to compress the abdomen.</li>
        <li>Remember that the upper part of the birth canal, in which the foetus is stuck, is directed backwards, so start by pulling the foetus dorsally relative to the mother.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>If Løvset's manoeuvre fails to deliver the shoulders,</b> it is usually a failure of technique. You may have to be a little firmer, or reach up a little higher to get the arm down. A broken arm will soon heal, so it is no disaster, and is better than letting the foetus die.</p>
    <p>LATER DIFFICULTIES DELIVERING A BREECH CPD<br> is the most important cause.</p>
    <p><b>If the head is stuck above the brim,</b> you are really in trouble. You may be able to draw it into the pelvis with the Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit manoeuvre. If this fails, the foetus will probably be dead, and the best treatment will be craniotomy (see below).</p>
    <p><b>If the head has entered the pelvis and the Mauriceau- Smellie-Veit manoeuvre fails to deliver it,</b> rotating the head in the pelvis may help. Stop struggling and think. What is the cause? If it is CPD, a quick symphysiotomy (21.7) may save the foetus. <i>Do this only if you are experienced.</i></p>
    <p><b>If there is hydrocephalus,</b> see 22.6.</p>
    <p><b>If CPD is the cause or the cervix is not fully dilated,</b> and you cannot deliver the foetus, apply gentle traction, and try to slip the cervix over his head. If this fails, avoid harming the mother and allow the foetus to die. While she is still in the lithotomy position, sedate the mother with pethidine 50mg and let the foetus hang for a while. The head will usually mould, or the cervix dilate, so that the foetus delivers in &#39;1hr. If this does not happen, traction with a bandage around the foetal legs and 1-3kg infusion bags as weights over the foot of the bed will succeed after some time.</p>
    <p><b>If the above measures fail and CPD is severe,</b> you may have to perform a CRANIOTOMY through the foramen magnum (unpleasant but effective: 21.8). Ask an assistant to pull down the body. Retract the anterior vaginal wall with a Sims' speculum and expose the back of the neck. Pick up a fold of the skin over the cervical spine with toothed forceps, and incise it transversely. Use curved Mayo's scissors to cut a tunnel under the skin up to the occipital bone, and push scissors into the head. Open the scissors and rotate them a few times to break up the brain compartments, withdrawing the scissors in an open position to enlarge the hole. Pull gently on the neck while the brain gradually escapes. Apply traction if delivery does not occur immediately.</p>
    <p><b>If the dead foetus protrudes from the vulva,</b> examine to feel if the cervix is fully dilated or not. If it is fully dilated, proceed directly to decompress the head with a craniotomy. If it is not fully dilated, apply traction. If this fails, perform a craniotomy.</p>
    <p>CAUTION! <i>Do not try to pull the head forcefully through the undilated cervix:</i> you may cause tears which extend into the lower segment.</p>
    <p><b>If the neck has been severed,</b> but the head has retracted into the uterus, it will be difficult to find and remove. Use ultrasound and craniotomy equipment.</p>
    <p><b>If the cord prolapses,</b> manage as you would with a cephalic presentation: perform a Caesarean Section, unless the cervix is fully dilated, and delivery is imminent. Cord prolapse is more common with breech deliveries, especially with a footling, but the foetal parts surrounding the cord are softer so that the cord is often not compressed completely.</p>
    <p>OTHER METHODS FOR BREECH DELIVERY</p>
    <p>BREECH EXTRACTION uses your pulling forces, rather than the mother&#39;s pushing forces. It is a quick way of delivering a small breech, usually a 2nd twin. It may be indicated for:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Delay with the second twin.</li>
        <li>Foetal distress with the second twin.</li>
        <li>Cord prolapse at full dilatation with a breech.</li>
        <li>A transverse lie in a second twin, following internal version.</li>
        <li>A dead foetus.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>METHOD.</p>
    <p>The mother must be in the lithotomy position. Proceed as for an assisted breech delivery. An episiotomy is usually indicated. Hook the index fingers of each hand into the foetal groins and pull, preferably during a contraction.</p>
    <p>When the umbilicus appears, hook out the legs by flexing the knees. Do this by applying lateral and dorsal pressure in the popliteal fossae, and by sweeping each leg laterally and downwards. Pull on the pelvis, keeping the back anterior. Pull posteriorly. A common error is to pull the foetus towards you, which is not in the axis of the birth canal. When you see the scapulae, hook out the arms.</p>
    <p>N.B. If the arms are not across the chest, perform Løvset's manoeuvre.
        Then push the head into the mother's pelvis from above. Then, if necessary, consider applying forceps to the after-coming head.</p>
    <p>The main difficulty is that the arms are more likely to be extended above the head, and the head is more likely to become deflexed. Løvset's manoeuvre and the Mauriceau- Smellie-Veit manoeuvre should solve these problems.</p>
    <p>If the foetus is dead:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pull on the leg(s), if you can reach them, or</li>
        <li>Use a combined breech hook and crotchet (19-1).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Pass the blunt hook end of this instrument over an extended leg into the groin, and pull on that. If the foetus is macerated the leg may be pulled off. If this is the case, turn the instrument round and hook the sharp crotchet end over the iliac crest. <i>Take care not to damage the birth canal!</i></p>
    <p><b>If the foetus is dead and its presenting part is high and it is a frank breech</b> so that you cannot get a grip on the legs, then it is often easy to introduce a Foley&#39;s catheter with a large balloon in the foetal pelvis via the anus. Inflate the balloon with 30-50ml water and pull. The traction you can apply is considerable because the balloon is caught behind the pelvic bones. <i>Never do this with a live foetus:</i> you will damage the rectum. A dead retained (perhaps macerated) 2nd twin can also be delivered in this way; likewise if the mother cannot push (due to shock, eclampsia, or panic). There is no overwhelming hurry in these cases and if this does not work immediately, traction with a weight on the catheter will.</p>
    <p>N.B. FORCEPS FOR THE AFTERCOMING HEAD.<br><i>Standard obstetric forceps, e.g. Neville Barnes type:</i></p>
    <ol>
        <li><i>are not easy to use on the aftercoming head,</i></li>
        <li><i>are liable to be misused if they are in the labour ward at all,</i></li>
        <li><i>create the impression for midwifery students that a breech delivery is something that only doctors can do. Outlet forceps (Wrigley's) are not long enough when you really need them. If they will reach the head they are hardly necessary in a breech delivery.</i></li>
    </ol>
