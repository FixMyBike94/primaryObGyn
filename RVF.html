<h1>Rectovaginal Fistula</h1>
    <p>Fistulae between the rectum and the vagina (RVF) are less
        common than those between the bladder and the vagina
        (VVF). If there is a large VVF, there may also be an RVF
        also when there is pressure exerted posteriorly (21
        -19B) on account of unrelieved obstructed labour. An RVF may
        occur, rarely, without a VVF. </p>
    <p>The diagnosis is obvious: faeces start to leak through the
        vagina.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, especially in babies but also in adults, an RVF
        may occur spontaneously due to HIV disease (26.2).
        They may also occur as a result of syphilis,
        lymphogranuloma venereum and other venereal diseases;
        and also due to carcinoma, itself HIV-related.</p>
    <p>To distinguish an RVF from a 3rd degree vaginal tear,
        clean away the faeces, and look at the perineum. If the site
        of the fistula is not obvious on inspection, digital palpation
        or proctoscopy, proceed to sigmoidoscopy. You might need
        to use ketamine to do this, remembering to position the
        patient before administering the drug. Note the position of
        the fistula, the degree of inflammation present, and its size.</p>
    <p>Repair of a RVF is not for the beginner. Chances of success
        are better early rather than late, providing the initial
        inflammation has settled, and they are significantly
        improved if you can divert the faecal stream beforehand.</p>
    <p>This will mean performing a defunctioning loop colostomy
        (11.6) which the patient may not tolerate well, and my think
        more debilitating than the RVF itself: so be cautious before
        inflicting this on a patient and make sure you explain
        carefully what it entails. It is only really worthwhile,
        if you have arranged RVF repair beforehand, and you can
        fashion the colostomy as a staged procedure.</p>
    <p>It is possible to treat low fistulae successfully with a seton,
        (26.3) but be prepared for it to take a long time till healing
        results.</p>
