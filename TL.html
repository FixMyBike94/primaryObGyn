<h1>Tubal Ligation</h1>
    <p>This should be one of the most common operations you do and many women and couples will be very grateful for it. Choose it after careful consideration of the alternatives (a copper IUD is good for 8yrs and nearly as effective, a hormone IUD is good for 5yrs and at least as effective but expensive), so your operation must be as safe and as painless as it can be. Try not to keep a mother waiting long for surgery, or she may become pregnant meanwhile!</p>

    <p>Large numbers of mothers would like their tubes tied, and if you take the trouble to encourage them, many will be willing to accept it. But however many ligations you do, you will probably be only able to satisfy a small fraction of the community's need.</p>
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Tie a woman's tubes at the same time that you perform a Caesarean Section</li>
      <li>Perform a 'mini-laparotomy', which is a laparotomy through a very small incision.</li>
      <li>Occlude the tubes through a laparoscope.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tying the tubes immediately after delivery (and to some extent after a miscarriage) has several advantages:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>They are easier to access when the uterus is still enlarged.</li>
      <li>The patient will already be in hospital, whereas if you discharge her and ask her to come back, she may never return.</li>
      <li>Immediately after a normal delivery/miscarriage she will tolerate the minimal additional trauma of sterilization particularly well. </li>
      <li>If you have already opened the abdomen for some other reason, including Caesarean Section (or perforation after a backstreet abortion), tying the tubes is easy. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are, however, some minor disadvantages in doing it at this time: (a) She may change her mind later, though in practice this is rare. (b) You may have not been able to exclude a serious abnormality in the newborn beforehand. </p>

    <p>INDICATIONS:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mothers who are sure they want no more babies.</li>
      <li>Medical diseases making pregnancy dangerous,
        particularly severe heart disease, renal failure, HIV disease
        or severe diabetes. </li>
      <li>Previous Caesarean Section where another Caesarean
        Section would be impossible to organize.</li>  
      <li>Ectopic gestation in a multipara. </li>
      <li>Severe psychiatric disease.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>CONTRAINDICATIONS.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Extreme obesity. </li>
      <li>Excessive anxiety. </li>
      <li>A history of PID causing severe adhesions to the uterus
        of a patient not in the immediate post-partum period.</li>
      <li>Infertility.</li>
      <li>Pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Refusal to give consent.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>CAUTION! Informed consent is essential, but does not
      usually legally need the agreement of the husband,
      although in some cultures leaving the husband out of the
      equation is unacceptable. Obviously it is better to discuss
      the option of TL early in pregnancy, but this does not
      mean you cannot introduce the subject during labour
      (especially if you have had no other opportunity)
      especially if you plan a Caesarean Section. </p>
    <p>A solution is to have a pre-printed area on every antenatal
      clinic card where nurses or midwives could record early in
      the pregnancy, <q>wishes for a TL</q>. This is especially
      important for a woman >30yrs who is para >2.</p>
    <p>If a woman is enthusiastic at once and she knows what you
      are talking about, it is patronising not to let her make use
      of the opportunity. Indeed, if you have to perform an
      emergency Caesarean Section, e.g. for failure to progress
      in a para 4 woman who presented late in hospital but you
      deliver a well baby, it is quite possible that any subsequent
      regret to consent to TL is far outweighed by the chance of
      death in the next pregnancy (from uterine rupture, placenta
      accreta, haemorrhage during a difficult Caesarean Section
      etc.). </p>  
    <p><em>In fact, most multipara regret not having been given the
        option of TL</em> at Caesarean Section. If in doubt, women will
        choose not to have a TL. There is no proof that women in
        Africa choose recklessly in favour of a TL.</p>
    <p>DUDUZILE, a 40yr old para 7 arrived in shock in the nick of time from a
      remote area with a bleeding ectopic gestation. A junior doctor operated
      on her, removed the affected tube but did not tie the other tube;
      he thought it unethical. When she understood that the next morning,
      she refused to leave the hospital till the other tube was likewise tied.
      She remembered her fear of dying and wished never to go through the
      same ordeal again.</p>
    <p>LESSON: After one ectopic gestation with a contralateral tube open,
      the chance of a further ectopic gestation is as high as 20-30%.</p> 
    <p>ARRANGEMENTS. It is best to perform TLs on a special
      operating list, and perform them early, so they are not
      displaced by other elective operations and emergencies.
      You may be able to run a <q>TL camp</q> or set up adequate
      preparations at a Health Centre. Normally intervention
      under LA, with or without some sedation, is possible.</p>
    <p>METHOD. (GRADE 2.3)
      Immediately before the operation, ask the patient to pass
      urine, to prevent you cutting into the distended bladder.
      This is important. Perform a careful bimanual examination
      to make sure that she is not already pregnant (although you
      can tie tubes during pregnancy without significant extra
      risk, to prevent the next pregnancy).</p> 
    <p>Use the semi-lithotomy position, with the thighs flexed to
      45<span>&#176;</span> and moderately abducted, the knees flexed, and the
      lower legs horizontal. Use Lloyd-Davies stirrups, or the
      cheaper <q>Chogoria</q> supports (19-3). Make sure you can
      put her in a head-down tilt and that she does not slide off
      the table!</p>
    <img class="chagoria" src="./resources/images/chagoria supports.png">
    <p>Clean the abdomen, perineum, and vagina, empty the
      bladder with a catheter (if it is not empty already),
      and cover her with an abdominal sheet. Pass a Sims or
      Auvard's speculum.</p>
    <p><strong>If >10days have elapsed since the 1st day of the last
      period,</strong> consider doing a D&C or suction curettage (23.4),
      to prevent implantation in this cycle. You may need
      paracervical anaesthesia. </p>
    <p>INCISION depends on the position of the fundus.
      <strong>If delivery has occurred within 4days, and the uterus is
      at the umbilicus or can easily be pushed there,</strong>
      make a 2cm horizontal incision in the inferior fold of the
      umbilicus. This is good cosmetically, and avoids the need
      for shaving. Also the abdominal wall is thinnest here.</p>
    <p><strong>If she is not postpartum,</strong> make a short transverse incision
      just above the pubic hair. If you have inserted a uterine
      manipulator, moving it helps you to decide where to
      operate exactly. Ask an assistant, with the manipulator,
      to raise the fundus against the abdominal wall until you
      see and feel a bulge (19-4A). Alternatively manipulate it
      yourself through the towels (experienced doctors can do
      this operation if need be without an assistant). </p>
    <p><strong>If you make an umbilical incision,</strong> stretch it and make a
      2cm horizontal incision in its inferior fold. Spread (do not
      cut) the subcutaneous tissue moving laterally with scissors
      until you see the fascia. Insert 2 small narrow right-angled
      retractors, and pull them apart laterally, while using them
      to pull aside all tissues between the skin and the fascia.</p> 
    <p>Pick up the fascia between two haemostats (one as much
      as possible to the right and one as much as possible to the
      left), and inject another 5ml lignocaine just beneath the
      fascia to anaesthetize the peritoneum. Open the fascia
      horizontally with a knife over the ridge you create when
      you lift the haemostats. You will find the fascia and the
      peritoneum fused so lifting it up prevents you cutting too
      deep.</p> 
    <p>If the peritoneum is not open yet do it bluntly by pushing
      closed forceps or scissors through it and pulling this
      instrument out in open position. The incision in the fascia
      should be large enough to admit your index finger.
      The skin will stretch, so you can make the skin incision
      shorter than the fascial one.</p>
   <p><strong>If you make a suprapubic incision,</strong>you have a similar
      approach but the incision is somewhat larger (reverse
      correlation with your experience). Enter the peritoneum as
      high as possible in your incision to stay away from the
      bladder. </p>
    <img class="mini-laparotomy" src="./resources/images/mini-laparotomy.png">
    <p><strong><em>After delivery,</em></strong> use your finger to locate a tube and sweep
      it from behind the uterus medially, visualize it and grasp it.
      You can easily move the uterus from left to right by
      pushing against it through the abdominal wall to let the
      tubes approach the umbilicus. Alternatively the incision
      can be moved with the retractors from left to right.</p>
    <p><strong><em>In the elective situation,</em></strong> using your finger is not such a
      good idea. It tends to hurt the patient, causing her to push.
      Bowel then appears in your incision and you can get
      stressed, operate more roughly, cause more pain, and so
      more pushing. Try to visualize the tubes and then pick
      them up (as distally as possible) with Babcock forceps.
      Your chances of seeing them increases with an easily
      directed light, a steep head-down tilt, a manipulator, the
      availability of a special instrument to fish out the tubes
      (a small ring on the end of a strait wire attached to a
      handle), patience, and an assistant talking to the patient,
      helping her to relax and breathe deeply. If all else fails,
      100mg ketamine IV at this stage will help. </p>
    <p>N.B. The tube is the middle (and top one) of the three
      lateral attachments to the fundus (dorsal ovarium, ventral
      round ligament) and has a lumen.</p>
    <p>Introduce some LA between the two blades of the
      mesosalpinx near the tube where you plan to tie it.
      Excise a segment, having ligated a loop (19-2).
       CAUTION! Check very carefully that there is no
      bleeding, cut the sutures on the tube, and then operate on
      the other tube in the same way.
      Close the fascia with continuous #1 monofilament.
      Close the subcutaneous dead space to minimize oozing.
      Close the skin with subcuticular absorbable.</p>
    <p>DIFFICULTIES WITH A MINI-LAPAROTOMY</p>
      <p><strong>If there is pain after you injected the LA,</strong> add sedation.
      A wide area of LA should prevent this. </p>
    <p>In obesity, it will be difficult to pull the tubes into view
      through a layer of fat. Enlarge the incision and apply more
      head-down tilt. An umbilical incision may be easier than
      you expect, because there is less fat around it</p>
    <p><strong>If you cannot find the tubes,</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>The incision may be too far above the fundus; it should
        be slightly below it. Turning the uterus with your finger
        behind might help if you are desperate. You may find it
        helpful not to release the first tube, until you have
        moved across the fundus and found the other one.
        Try passing Cusco's speculum through the incision to help
        you look around. </li>
      <li>The uterus may be stuck down with adhesions.
        A careful initial pelvic examination should have excluded
        this. Dense adhesions require GA to enable you to operate
        safely. If the tubes are adherent to the uterus or the pelvis,
        you may have to make a standard incision, or abandon the
        operation. This is particularly likely to happen if there are
        adhesions following Caesarean Section.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>If you find any ovarian cysts,</strong> leave them if they are
      < 5cm. Often normal ovaries have some physiological
      cysts. If a cyst is larger or a possible dermoid, collapse it
      by draining it with a syringe and needle, pull it into the
      wound, and excise it.</p>
    <p><strong>If you open the bladder,</strong> close it with absorbable sutures
      in two layers, and leave a catheter in situ for 7days.
      Prevent a full bladder by having her empty it just before
      she enters the theatre. If you find it full at surgery, empty it
      with a catheter or a needle and syringe.</p>
    <p><strong>If you open the bowel,</strong> close it in two layers transversely,
      and observe closely for signs of sepsis, abdominal
      tenderness or distension suggesting a bowel leak.</p>
    <p>Once you have mastered the mini-laparotomy technique,
      you can also use it for ectopic gestation (or ovarian cysts).<br><br><br></p>
